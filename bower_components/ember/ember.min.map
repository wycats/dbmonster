What an opportunity to\n    // optimize this code!\" then to you I say: stop! For I have a tale to tell.\n    //\n    // First, this code must be compatible with simple-dom for rendering on the\n    // server where there is no real DOM. Previously, we accessed a child node\n    // directly via `element.childNodes[index]`. While we *could* in theory do a\n    // full-fidelity simulation of a live `childNodes` array, this is slow,\n    // complicated and error-prone.\n    //\n    // \"No problem,\" we thought, \"we'll just use the similar\n    // `childNodes.item(index)` API.\" Then, we could just implement our own `item`\n    // method in simple-dom and walk the child node linked list there, allowing\n    // us to retain the performance advantages of the (surely optimized) `item()`\n    // API in the browser.\n    //\n    // Unfortunately, an enterprising soul named Samy Alzahrani discovered that in\n    // IE8, accessing an item out-of-bounds via `item()` causes an exception where\n    // other browsers return null. This necessitated a... check of\n    // `childNodes.length`, bringing us back around to having to support a\n    // full-fidelity `childNodes` array!\n    //\n    // Worst of all, Kris Selden investigated how browsers are actualy implemented\n    // and discovered that they're all linked lists under the hood anyway. Accessing\n    // `childNodes` requires them to allocate a new live collection backed by that\n    // linked list, which is itself a rather expensive operation. Our assumed\n    // optimization had backfired! That is the danger of magical thinking about\n    // the performance of native implementations.\n    //\n    // And this, my friends, is why the following implementation just walks the\n    // linked list, as surprised as that may make you.

It helps to instantiate, initialize and coordinate the many\n    objects that make up your app.\n\n    Each Ember app has one and only one `Ember.Application` object. In fact, the\n    very first thing you should do in your application is create the instance:\n\n    ```javascript\n    window.App = Ember.Application.create();\n    ```\n\n    Typically, the application object is the only global variable. All other\n    classes in your app should be properties on the `Ember.Application` instance,\n    which highlights its first role: a global namespace.\n\n    For example, if you define a view class, it might look like this:\n\n    ```javascript\n    App.MyView = Ember.View.extend();\n    ```\n\n    By default, calling `Ember.Application.create()` will automatically initialize\n    your application by calling the `Ember.Application.initialize()` method. If\n    you need to delay initialization, you can call your app's `deferReadiness()`\n    method. When you are ready for your app to be initialized, call its\n    `advanceReadiness()` method.\n\n    You can define a `ready` method on the `Ember.Application` instance, which\n    will be run by Ember when the application is initialized.\n\n    Because `Ember.Application` inherits from `Ember.Namespace`, any classes\n    you create will have useful string representations when calling `toString()`.\n    See the `Ember.Namespace` documentation for more information.\n\n    While you can think of your `Ember.Application` as a container that holds the\n    other classes in your application, there are several other responsibilities\n    going on under-the-hood that you may want to understand.\n\n    ### Event Delegation\n\n    Ember uses a technique called _event delegation_. This allows the framework\n    to set up a global, shared event listener instead of requiring each view to\n    do it manually. For example, instead of each view registering its own\n    `mousedown` listener on its associated element, Ember sets up a `mousedown`\n    listener on the `body`.\n\n    If a `mousedown` event occurs, Ember will look at the target of the event and\n    start walking up the DOM node tree, finding corresponding views and invoking\n    their `mouseDown` method as it goes.\n\n    `Ember.Application` has a number of default events that it listens for, as\n    well as a mapping from lowercase events to camel-cased view method names. For\n    example, the `keypress` event causes the `keyPress` method on the view to be\n    called, the `dblclick` event causes `doubleClick` to be called, and so on.\n\n    If there is a bubbling browser event that Ember does not listen for by\n    default, you can specify custom events and their corresponding view method\n    names by setting the application's `customEvents` property:\n\n    ```javascript\n    var App = Ember.Application.create({\n      customEvents: {\n        // add support for the paste event\n        paste: 'paste'\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n\n    By default, the application sets up these event listeners on the document\n    body. However, in cases where you are embedding an Ember application inside\n    an existing page, you may want it to set up the listeners on an element\n    inside the body.\n\n    For example, if only events inside a DOM element with the ID of `ember-app`\n    should be delegated, set your application's `rootElement` property:\n\n    ```javascript\n    var App = Ember.Application.create({\n      rootElement: '#ember-app'\n    });\n    ```\n\n    The `rootElement` can be either a DOM element or a jQuery-compatible selector\n    string. Note that *views appended to the DOM outside the root element will\n    not receive events.* If you specify a custom root element, make sure you only\n    append views inside it!\n\n    To learn more about the advantages of event delegation and the Ember view\n    layer, and a list of the event listeners that are setup by default, visit the\n    [Ember View Layer guide](http://emberjs.com/guides/understanding-ember/the-view-layer/#toc_event-delegation).\n\n    ### Initializers\n\n    Libraries on top of Ember can add initializers, like so:\n\n    ```javascript\n    Ember.Application.initializer({\n      name: 'api-adapter',\n\n      initialize: function(container, application) {\n        application.register('api-adapter:main', ApiAdapter);\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n\n    Initializers provide an opportunity to access the container, which\n    organizes the different components of an Ember application. Additionally\n    they provide a chance to access the instantiated application. Beyond\n    being used for libraries, initializers are also a great way to organize\n    dependency injection or setup in your own application.\n\n    ### Routing\n\n    In addition to creating your application's router, `Ember.Application` is\n    also responsible for telling the router when to start routing. Transitions\n    between routes can be logged with the `LOG_TRANSITIONS` flag, and more\n    detailed intra-transition logging can be logged with\n    the `LOG_TRANSITIONS_INTERNAL` flag:\n\n    ```javascript\n    var App = Ember.Application.create({\n      LOG_TRANSITIONS: true, // basic logging of successful transitions\n      LOG_TRANSITIONS_INTERNAL: true // detailed logging of all routing steps\n    });\n    ```\n\n    By default, the router will begin trying to translate the current URL into\n    application state once the browser emits the `DOMContentReady` event. If you\n    need to defer routing, you can call the application's `deferReadiness()`\n    method. Once routing can begin, call the `advanceReadiness()` method.\n\n    If there is any setup required before routing begins, you can implement a\n    `ready()` method on your app that will be invoked immediately before routing\n    begins.\n\n    @class Application\n    @namespace Ember\n    @extends Ember.Namespace\n  */\n\n  var Application = Namespace['default'].extend(DeferredMixin['default'], {\n    _suppressDeferredDeprecation: true,\n\n    /**\n      The root DOM element of the Application.

This is often used to\n      provide services to a set of framework components.\n       An example of providing a session object to all controllers:\n       ```javascript\n      var App = Ember.Application.create();\n      var Session = Ember.Object.extend({ isAuthenticated: false });\n       // A factory must be registered before it can be injected\n      App.register('session:main', Session);\n       // Inject 'session:main' onto all factories of the type 'controller'\n      // with the name 'session'\n      App.inject('controller', 'session', 'session:main');\n       App.IndexController = Ember.Controller.extend({\n        isLoggedIn: Ember.computed.alias('session.isAuthenticated')\n      });\n      ```\n       Injections can also be performed on specific factories.\n       ```javascript\n      App.inject(<full_name or type>, <property name>, <full_name>)\n      App.inject('route', 'source', 'source:main')\n      App.inject('route:application', 'email', 'model:email')\n      ```\n       It is important to note that injections can only be performed on\n      classes that are instantiated by Ember itself. Instantiating a class\n      directly (via `create` or `new`) bypasses the dependency injection\n      system.\n       **Note:** Ember-Data instantiates its models in a unique manner, and consequently\n      injections onto models (or all models) will not work as expected.

     Ember.Application.initializer({\n        name: 'second',\n        after: 'first',\n         initialize: function(container, application) {\n          Ember.debug('Second initializer!');\n

For example, `controller:post` looks up\n      `App.PostController` by default.\n    * there are some nuances (see examples below)\n\n    ### How Resolving Works\n\n    The container calls this object's `resolve` method with the\n    `fullName` argument.\n\n    It first parses the fullName into an object using `parseName`.\n\n    Then it checks for the presence of a type-specific instance\n    method of the form `resolve[Type]` and calls it if it exists.\n    For example if it was resolving 'template:post', it would call\n    the `resolveTemplate` method.\n\n    Its last resort is to call the `resolveOther` method.\n\n    The methods of this object are designed to be easy to override\n    in a subclass. For example, you could enhance how a template\n    is resolved like so:\n\n    ```javascript\n    App = Ember.Application.create({\n      Resolver: Ember.DefaultResolver.extend({\n        resolveTemplate: function(parsedName) {\n          var resolvedTemplate = this._super(parsedName);\n          if (resolvedTemplate) { return resolvedTemplate; }\n          return Ember.TEMPLATES['not_found'];\n        }\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n\n    Some examples of how names are resolved:\n\n    ```\n    'template:post'           //=> Ember.TEMPLATES['post']\n    'template:posts/byline'   //=> Ember.TEMPLATES['posts/byline']\n    'template:posts.byline'   //=> Ember.TEMPLATES['posts/byline']\n    'template:blogPost'       //=> Ember.TEMPLATES['blogPost']\n                              //   OR\n                              //   Ember.TEMPLATES['blog_post']\n    'controller:post'         //=> App.PostController\n    'controller:posts.index'  //=> App.PostsIndexController\n    'controller:blog/post'    //=> Blog.PostController\n    'controller:basic'        //=> Ember.Controller\n    'route:post'              //=> App.PostRoute\n    'route:posts.index'       //=> App.PostsIndexRoute\n    'route:blog/post'         //=> Blog.PostRoute\n    'route:basic'             //=> Ember.Route\n    'view:post'               //=> App.PostView\n    'view:posts.index'        //=> App.PostsIndexView\n    'view:blog/post'          //=> Blog.PostView\n    'view:basic'              //=> Ember.View\n    'foo:post'                //=> App.PostFoo\n    'model:post'              //=> App.Post\n    ```\n\n    @class DefaultResolver\n    @namespace Ember\n    @extends Ember.Object\n  */\n  exports['default'] = EmberObject['default'].extend({\n    /**\n      This will be set to the Application instance when it is\n      created.\n       @property namespace\n    */\n    namespace: null,\n\n    init: function () {\n      this._parseNameCache = dictionary['default'](null);\n    },\n    normalize: function (fullName) {\n      var split = fullName.split(\":\", 2);\n      var type = split[0];\n      var name = split[1];\n\n      \n      if (type !== \"template\") {\n        var result = name;\n\n        if (result.indexOf(\".\") > -1) {\n          result = result.replace(/\\.(.)/g, function (m) {\n            return m.charAt(1).toUpperCase();\n          });\n        }\n\n        if (name.indexOf(\"_\") > -1) {\n          result = result.replace(/_(.)/g, function (m) {\n            return m.charAt(1).toUpperCase();\n          });\n        }\n\n        return type + \":\" + result;\n      } else {\n        return fullName;\n      }\n    },\n\n    /**\n      This method is called via the container's resolver method.\n      It parses the provided `fullName` and then looks up and\n      returns the appropriate template or class.\n       @method resolve\n      @param {String} fullName the lookup string\n      @return {Object} the resolved factory\n    */\n    resolve: function (fullName) {\n      var parsedName = this.parseName(fullName);\n      var resolveMethodName = parsedName.resolveMethodName;\n      var resolved;\n\n      if (this[resolveMethodName]) {\n        resolved = this[resolveMethodName](parsedName);\n      }\n\n      resolved = resolved || this.resolveOther(parsedName);\n\n      if (parsedName.root && parsedName.root.LOG_RESOLVER) {\n        this._logLookup(resolved, parsedName);\n      }\n\n      return resolved;\n    },\n\n    /**\n      Convert the string name of the form 'type:name' to\n      a Javascript object with the parsed aspects of the name\n      broken out.\n       @protected\n      @param {String} fullName the lookup string\n      @method parseName\n    */\n\n    parseName: function (fullName) {\n      return this._parseNameCache[fullName] || (this._parseNameCache[fullName] = this._parseName(fullName));\n    },\n\n    _parseName: function (fullName) {\n      var nameParts = fullName.split(\":\");\n      var type = nameParts[0];\n      var fullNameWithoutType = nameParts[1];\n      var name = fullNameWithoutType;\n      var namespace = property_get.get(this, \"namespace\");\n      var root = namespace;\n\n      if (type !== \"template\" && name.indexOf(\"/\") !== -1) {\n        var parts = name.split(\"/\");\n        name = parts[parts.length - 1];\n        var namespaceName = string.capitalize(parts.slice(0, -1).join(\".\"));\n        root = Namespace['default'].byName(namespaceName);\n\n              }\n\n      var resolveMethodName = fullNameWithoutType === \"main\" ?

Bound helpers behave similarly to regular\n    handlebars helpers, with the added ability to re-render when the underlying data\n    changes.\n\n    ## Simple example\n\n    ```javascript\n    Ember.Handlebars.registerBoundHelper('capitalize', function(value) {\n      return Ember.String.capitalize(value);\n    });\n    ```\n\n    The above bound helper can be used inside of templates as follows:\n\n    ```handlebars\n    {{capitalize name}}\n    ```\n\n    In this case, when the `name` property of the template's context changes,\n    the rendered value of the helper will update to reflect this change.\n\n    ## Example with options\n\n    Like normal handlebars helpers, bound helpers have access to the options\n    passed into the helper call.\n\n    ```javascript\n    Ember.Handlebars.registerBoundHelper('repeat', function(value, options) {\n      var count = options.hash.count;\n      var a = [];\n      while(a.length < count) {\n          a.push(value);\n      }\n      return a.join('');\n    });\n    ```\n\n    This helper could be used in a template as follows:\n\n    ```handlebars\n    {{repeat text count=3}}\n    ```\n\n    ## Example with bound options\n\n    Bound hash options are also supported. Example:\n\n    ```handlebars\n    {{repeat text count=numRepeats}}\n    ```\n\n    In this example, count will be bound to the value of\n    the `numRepeats` property on the context. If that property\n    changes, the helper will be re-rendered.\n\n    ## Example with extra dependencies\n\n    The `Ember.Handlebars.registerBoundHelper` method takes a variable length\n    third parameter which indicates extra dependencies on the passed in value.\n    This allows the handlebars helper to update when these dependencies change.\n\n    ```javascript\n    Ember.Handlebars.registerBoundHelper('capitalizeName', function(value) {\n      return value.get('name').toUpperCase();\n    }, 'name');\n    ```\n\n    ## Example with multiple bound properties\n\n    `Ember.Handlebars.registerBoundHelper` supports binding to\n    multiple properties, e.g.:\n\n    ```javascript\n    Ember.Handlebars.registerBoundHelper('concatenate', function() {\n      var values = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 0, -1);\n      return values.join('||');\n    });\n    ```\n\n    Which allows for template syntax such as `{{concatenate prop1 prop2}}` or\n    `{{concatenate prop1 prop2 prop3}}`. If any of the properties change,\n    the helper will re-render.  Note that dependency keys cannot be\n    using in conjunction with multi-property helpers, since it is ambiguous\n    which property the dependent keys would belong to.\n\n    ## Use with unbound helper\n\n    The `{{unbound}}` helper can be used with bound helper invocations\n    to render them in their unbound form, e.g.\n\n    ```handlebars\n    {{unbound capitalize name}}\n    ```\n\n    In this example, if the name property changes, the helper\n    will not re-render.\n\n    ## Use with blocks not supported\n\n    Bound helpers do not support use with Handlebars blocks or\n    the addition of child views of any kind.\n\n    @method registerBoundHelper\n    @for Ember.Handlebars\n    @param {String} name\n    @param {Function} function\n    @param {String} dependentKeys*\n  */\n  exports['default'] = registerBoundHelper;\n  /**\n  @module ember\n  @submodule ember-htmlbars\n  */\n\n  var slice = [].slice;\n  function registerBoundHelper(name, fn) {\n    var boundHelperArgs = slice.call(arguments, 1);\n    var boundFn = makeBoundHelper['default'].apply(this, boundHelperArgs);\n\n    helpers['default'][name] = boundFn;\n  }\n\n});","define('ember-htmlbars/env', ['exports', 'ember-metal/environment', 'dom-helper', 'htmlbars-runtime', 'ember-metal/merge', 'ember-htmlbars/hooks/subexpr', 'ember-htmlbars/hooks/concat', 'ember-htmlbars/hooks/link-render-node', 'ember-htmlbars/hooks/create-fresh-scope', 'ember-htmlbars/hooks/create-shadow-scope', 'ember-htmlbars/hooks/bind-self', 'ember-htmlbars/hooks/bind-scope', 'ember-htmlbars/hooks/bind-local', 'ember-htmlbars/hooks/get-root', 'ember-htmlbars/hooks/get-child', 'ember-htmlbars/hooks/get-value', 'ember-htmlbars/hooks/cleanup', 'ember-htmlbars/hooks/classify', 'ember-htmlbars/hooks/component', 'ember-htmlbars/hooks/lookup-helper', 'ember-htmlbars/hooks/has-helper', 'ember-htmlbars/helpers', 'ember-htmlbars/keywords/debugger', 'ember-htmlbars/keywords/with', 'ember-htmlbars/keywords/outlet', 'ember-htmlbars/keywords/unbound', 'ember-htmlbars/keywords/view', 'ember-htmlbars/keywords/component', 'ember-htmlbars/keywords/partial'], function (exports, environment, DOMHelper, htmlbars_runtime, merge, subexpr, concat, linkRenderNode, createFreshScope, createShadowScope, bindSelf, bindScope, bindLocal, getRoot, getChild, getValue, cleanup, classify, component, lookupHelper, hasHelper, helpers, debuggerKeyword, withKeyword, outlet, unbound, view, componentKeyword, partial) {\n\n  'use strict';\n\n  var emberHooks = merge['default']({}, htmlbars_runtime.hooks);\n\n  merge['default'](emberHooks, {\n    linkRenderNode: linkRenderNode['default'],\n    createFreshScope: createFreshScope['default'],\n    createShadowScope: createShadowScope['default'],\n    bindSelf: bindSelf['default'],\n    bindScope: bindScope['default'],\n    bindLocal: bindLocal['default'],\n    getRoot: getRoot['default'],\n    getChild: getChild['default'],\n    getValue: getValue['default'],\n    subexpr: subexpr['default'],\n    concat: concat['default'],\n    cleanup: cleanup['default'],\n    classify: classify['default'],\n    component: component['default'],\n    lookupHelper: lookupHelper['default'],\n    hasHelper: hasHelper['default']\n  });\n\n  merge['default'](emberHooks.keywords, {\n    \"debugger\": debuggerKeyword['default'],\n    \"with\": withKeyword['default'],\n    outlet: outlet['default'],\n    unbound: unbound['default'],\n    view: view['default'],\n    component: componentKeyword['default'],\n    partial: partial['default']\n  });\n\n  exports['default'] = {\n    hooks: emberHooks,\n    helpers: helpers['default'],\n    useFragmentCache: true\n  };\n\n  var domHelper = environment['default'].hasDOM ?

Instead, use `{{#with foo.bar as baz}}`.\n    ### `controller` option\n    Adding `controller='something'` instructs the `{{with}}` helper to create and use an instance of\n    the specified

The value of this property should be a string representing a path\n    to another object or a custom binding instance created using Binding helpers\n    (see \"One Way Bindings\"):\n\n    ```\n    valueBinding: \"MyApp.someController.title\"\n    ```\n\n    This will create a binding from `MyApp.someController.title` to the `value`\n    property of your object instance automatically. Now the two values will be\n    kept in sync.\n\n    ## One Way Bindings\n\n    One especially useful binding customization you can use is the `oneWay()`\n    helper. This helper tells Ember that you are only interested in\n    receiving changes on the object you are binding from. For example, if you\n    are binding to a preference and you want to be notified if the preference\n    has changed, but your object will not be changing the preference itself, you\n    could do:\n\n    ```\n    bigTitlesBinding: Ember.Binding.oneWay(\"MyApp.preferencesController.bigTitles\")\n    ```\n\n    This way if the value of `MyApp.preferencesController.bigTitles` changes the\n    `bigTitles` property of your object will change also. However, if you\n    change the value of your `bigTitles` property, it will not update the\n    `preferencesController`.\n\n    One way bindings are almost twice as fast to setup and twice as fast to\n    execute because the binding only has to worry about changes to one side.\n\n    You should consider using one way bindings anytime you have an object that\n    may be created frequently and you do not intend to change a property; only\n    to monitor it for changes (such as in the example above).\n\n    ## Adding Bindings Manually\n\n    All of the examples above show you how to configure a custom binding, but the\n    result of these customizations will be a binding template, not a fully active\n    Binding instance. The binding will actually become active only when you\n    instantiate the object the binding belongs to. It is useful however, to\n    understand what actually happens when the binding is activated.\n\n    For a binding to function it must have at least a `from` property and a `to`\n    property. The `from` property path points to the object/key that you want to\n    bind from while the `to` path points to the object/key you want to bind to.\n\n    When you define a custom binding, you are usually describing the property\n    you want to bind from (such as `MyApp.someController.value` in the examples\n    above). When your object is created, it will automatically assign the value\n    you want to bind `to` based on the name of your binding key. In the\n    examples above, during init, Ember objects will effectively call\n    something like this on your binding:\n\n    ```javascript\n    binding = Ember.Binding.from(\"valueBinding\").to(\"value\");\n    ```\n\n    This creates a new binding instance based on the template you provide, and\n    sets the to path to the `value` property of the new object. Now that the\n    binding is fully configured with a `from` and a `to`, it simply needs to be\n    connected to become active. This is done through the `connect()` method:\n\n    ```javascript\n    binding.connect(this);\n    ```\n\n    Note that when you connect a binding you pass the object you want it to be\n    connected to. This object will be used as the root for both the from and\n    to side of the binding when inspecting relative paths. This allows the\n    binding to be automatically inherited by subclassed objects as well.\n\n    This also allows you to bind between objects using the paths you declare in\n    `from` and `to`:\n\n    ```javascript\n    // Example 1\n    binding = Ember.Binding.from(\"App.someObject.value\").to(\"value\");\n    binding.connect(this);\n\n    // Example 2\n    binding = Ember.Binding.from(\"parentView.value\").to(\"App.someObject.value\");\n    binding.connect(this);\n    ```\n\n    Now that the binding is connected, it will observe both the from and to side\n    and relay changes.\n\n    If you ever needed to do so (you almost never will, but it is useful to\n    understand this anyway), you could manually create an active binding by\n    using the `Ember.bind()` helper method. (This is the same method used by\n    to setup your bindings on objects):\n\n    ```javascript\n    Ember.bind(MyApp.anotherObject, \"value\", \"MyApp.someController.value\");\n    ```\n\n    Both of these code fragments have the same effect as doing the most friendly\n    form of binding creation like so:\n\n    ```javascript\n    MyApp.anotherObject = Ember.Object.create({\n      valueBinding: \"MyApp.someController.value\",\n\n      // OTHER CODE FOR THIS OBJECT...\n    });\n    ```\n\n    Ember's built in binding creation method makes it easy to automatically\n    create bindings for you. You should always use the highest-level APIs\n    available, even if you understand how it works underneath.\n\n    @class Binding\n    @namespace Ember\n    @since Ember 0.9\n  */\n  // Ember.Binding = Binding; ES6TODO: where to put this?\n\n  /**\n    Global helper method to create a new binding.

The fullName function\n    will be called once (regardless of how many times it is accessed) as long\n    as its dependencies have not changed. Once firstName or lastName are updated\n    any future calls (or anything bound) to fullName will incorporate the new\n    values.\n\n    ```javascript\n    var Person = Ember.Object.extend({\n      // these will be supplied by `create`\n      firstName: null,\n      lastName: null,\n\n      fullName: function() {\n        var firstName = this.get('firstName');\n        var lastName = this.get('lastName');\n\n       return firstName + ' ' + lastName;\n      }.property('firstName', 'lastName')\n    });\n\n    var tom = Person.create({\n      firstName: 'Tom',\n      lastName: 'Dale'\n    });\n\n    tom.get('fullName') // 'Tom Dale'\n    ```\n\n    You can also define what Ember should do when setting a computed property.\n    If you try to set a computed property, it will be invoked with the key and\n    value you want to set it to. You can also accept the previous value as the\n    third parameter.\n\n    ```javascript\n    var Person = Ember.Object.extend({\n      // these will be supplied by `create`\n      firstName: null,\n      lastName: null,\n\n      fullName: function(key, value, oldValue) {\n        // getter\n        if (arguments.length === 1) {\n          var firstName = this.get('firstName');\n          var lastName = this.get('lastName');\n\n          return firstName + ' ' + lastName;\n\n        // setter\n        } else {\n          var name = value.split(' ');\n\n          this.set('firstName', name[0]);\n          this.set('lastName', name[1]);\n\n          return value;\n        }\n      }.property('firstName', 'lastName')\n    });\n\n    var person = Person.create();\n\n    person.set('fullName', 'Peter Wagenet');\n    person.get('firstName'); // 'Peter'\n    person.get('lastName');  // 'Wagenet'\n    ```\n\n    @class ComputedProperty\n    @namespace Ember\n    @extends Ember.Descriptor\n    @constructor\n  */\n  function ComputedProperty(config, opts) {\n    this.isDescriptor = true;\n    if (Ember.FEATURES.isEnabled(\"new-computed-syntax\")) {\n      if (typeof config === \"function\") {\n        config.__ember_arity = config.length;\n        this._getter = config;\n        if (config.__ember_arity > 1) {\n          this._setter = config;\n        }\n      } else {\n        this._getter = config.get;\n        this._setter = config.set;\n        if (this._setter && this._setter.__ember_arity === undefined) {\n          this._setter.__ember_arity = this._setter.length;\n        }\n      }\n    } else {\n      config.__ember_arity = config.length;\n      this._getter = config;\n      if (config.__ember_arity > 1) {\n        this._setter = config;\n      }\n    }\n\n    this._dependentKeys = undefined;\n    this._suspended = undefined;\n    this._meta = undefined;\n\n        this._cacheable = opts && opts.cacheable !== undefined ? opts.cacheable : true; // TODO: Set always to `true` once this deprecation is gone.\n    this._dependentKeys = opts && opts.dependentKeys;\n        this._readOnly = opts && (opts.readOnly !== undefined || !!opts.readOnly) || false; // TODO: Set always to `false` once this deprecation is gone.\n  }\n\n  ComputedProperty.prototype = new properties.Descriptor();\n\n  var ComputedPropertyPrototype = ComputedProperty.prototype;\n\n  /**\n    Properties are cacheable by default.

Currently,\n    TinyMCE provides a setup configuration option we can use to do some processing\n    after the TinyMCE instance is initialized but before it is actually rendered.\n    We can use that setup option to do some additional setup for our component.\n    The component itself could look something like the following:\n\n    ```javascript\n    App.RichTextEditorComponent = Ember.Component.extend({\n      initializeTinyMCE: function() {\n        tinymce.init({\n          selector: '#' + this.$().prop('id'),\n          setup: Ember.run.bind(this, this.setupEditor)\n        });\n      }.on('didInsertElement'),\n\n      setupEditor: function(editor) {\n        this.set('editor', editor);\n\n        editor.on('change', function() {\n          console.log('content changed!');\n        });\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n\n    In this example, we use Ember.run.bind to bind the setupEditor message to the\n    context of the App.RichTextEditorComponent and to have the invocation of that\n    method be safely handled and executed by the Ember run loop.\n\n    @method bind\n    @namespace Ember\n    @param {Object} [target] target of method to call\n    @param {Function|String} method Method to invoke.\n      May be a function or a string. If you pass a string\n      then it will be looked up on the passed target.\n    @param {Object} [args*] Any additional arguments you wish to pass to the method.\n    @return {Function} returns a new function that will always have a particular context\n    @since 1.4.0\n  */\n  run.bind = function (target, method /* args */) {\n    var args = slice.call(arguments);\n    return function () {\n      return run.join.apply(run, args.concat(slice.call(arguments)));\n    };\n  };\n\n  run.backburner = backburner;\n  run.currentRunLoop = null;\n  run.queues = backburner.queueNames;\n\n  /**\n    Begins a new RunLoop.

This is\n    a lower-level way to use a RunLoop instead of using `run()`.\n\n    ```javascript\n    run.begin();\n    // code to be executed within a RunLoop\n    run.end();\n    ```\n\n    @method begin\n    @return {void}\n  */\n  run.begin = function () {\n    backburner.begin();\n  };\n\n  /**\n    Ends a RunLoop.

Example:\n\n    ```javascript\n    App.MyCollectionView = Ember.CollectionView.extend({\n      didInsertElement: function() {\n        run.scheduleOnce('afterRender', this, 'processChildElements');\n      },\n      processChildElements: function() {\n        // ... do something with collectionView's child view\n        // elements after they've finished rendering, which\n        // can't be done within the CollectionView's\n        // `didInsertElement` hook because that gets run\n        // before the child elements have been added to the DOM.\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n\n    One benefit of the above approach compared to using `run.next` is\n    that you will be able to perform DOM/CSS operations before unprocessed\n    elements are rendered to the screen, which may prevent flickering or\n    other artifacts caused by delaying processing until after rendering.\n\n    The other major benefit to the above approach is that `run.next`\n    introduces an element of non-determinism, which can make things much\n    harder to test, due to its reliance on `setTimeout`; it's much harder\n    to guarantee the order of scheduled operations when they are scheduled\n    outside of the current run loop, i.e. with `run.next`.\n\n    @method next\n    @param {Object} [target] target of method to invoke\n    @param {Function|String} method The method to invoke.\n      If you pass a string it will be resolved on the\n      target at the time the method is invoked.\n    @param {Object} [args*] Optional arguments to pass to the timeout.\n    @return {Object} Timer information for use in cancelling, see `run.cancel`.\n  */\n  run.next = function () {\n    var args = slice.call(arguments);\n    args.push(1);\n    return utils.apply(backburner, backburner.later, args);\n  };\n\n  /**\n    Cancels a scheduled item.

The Rope provides a memory efficient\n    data-structure for strings created from concatenation or some other string\n    manipulation like splitting.\n\n    Unfortunately checking equality of different ropes can be quite costly as\n    runtimes must resort to clever string comparison algorithms.

One of these criteria can be the size of the entire rope.\n    For example, in chrome 38 a rope longer then 12 characters will not\n    intern, nor will segments of that rope.\n\n    Some numbers: http://jsperf.com/eval-vs-keys/8\n\n    Known Trick™\n\n    @private\n    @return {String} interned version of the provided string\n  */\n  function intern(str) {\n    var obj = {};\n    obj[str] = 1;\n    for (var key in obj) {\n      if (key === str) {\n        return key;\n      }\n    }\n    return str;\n  }\n  function symbol(debugName) {\n    // TODO: Investigate using platform symbols, but we do not\n    // want to require non-enumerability for this API, which\n    // would introduce a large cost.\n\n    return intern(debugName + \" [id=\" + GUID_KEY + Math.floor(Math.random() * new Date()) + \"]\");\n  }\n\n  /**\n    A unique key used to assign guids and other private metadata to objects.\n    If you inspect an object in your browser debugger you will often see these.\n    They can be safely ignored.\n\n    On browsers that support it, these properties are added with enumeration\n    disabled so they won't show up when you iterate over your properties.\n\n    @private\n    @property GUID_KEY\n    @for Ember\n    @type String\n    @final\n  */\n  var GUID_KEY = intern(\"__ember\" + +new Date());\n\n  var GUID_DESC = {\n    writable: true,\n    configurable: true,\n    enumerable: false,\n    value: null\n  };\n\n  var undefinedDescriptor = {\n    configurable: true,\n    writable: true,\n    enumerable: false,\n    value: undefined\n  };\n\n  var nullDescriptor = {\n    configurable: true,\n    writable: true,\n    enumerable: false,\n    value: null\n  };\n\n  var META_DESC = {\n    writable: true,\n    configurable: true,\n    enumerable: false,\n    value: null\n  };\n\n  var EMBER_META_PROPERTY = {\n    name: \"__ember_meta__\",\n    descriptor: META_DESC\n  };\n\n  var GUID_KEY_PROPERTY = {\n    name: GUID_KEY,\n    descriptor: nullDescriptor\n  };\n\n  var NEXT_SUPER_PROPERTY = {\n    name: \"__nextSuper\",\n    descriptor: undefinedDescriptor\n  };\n  function generateGuid(obj, prefix) {\n    if (!prefix) {\n      prefix = GUID_PREFIX;\n    }\n\n    var ret = prefix + uuid();\n    if (obj) {\n      if (obj[GUID_KEY] === null) {\n        obj[GUID_KEY] = ret;\n      } else {\n        GUID_DESC.value = ret;\n        if (obj.__defineNonEnumerable) {\n          obj.__defineNonEnumerable(GUID_KEY_PROPERTY);\n        } else {\n          define_property.defineProperty(obj, GUID_KEY, GUID_DESC);\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    return ret;\n  }\n\n  function guidFor(obj) {\n\n    // special cases where we don't want to add a key to object\n    if (obj === undefined) {\n      return \"(undefined)\";\n    }\n\n    if (obj === null) {\n      return \"(null)\";\n    }\n\n    var ret;\n    var type = typeof obj;\n\n    // Don't allow prototype changes to String etc. to change the guidFor\n    switch (type) {\n      case \"number\":\n        ret = numberCache[obj];\n\n        if (!ret) {\n          ret = numberCache[obj] = \"nu\" + obj;\n        }\n\n        return ret;\n\n      case \"string\":\n        ret = stringCache[obj];\n\n        if (!ret) {\n          ret = stringCache[obj] = \"st\" + uuid();\n        }\n\n        return ret;\n\n      case \"boolean\":\n        return obj ?

In this case, no additional parameters will be passed.\n\n    If you provide additional parameters to the helper:\n\n    ```handlebars\n    <button {{action 'edit' post}}>Edit</button>\n    ```\n\n    Those parameters will be passed along as arguments to the JavaScript\n    function implementing the action.\n\n    ### Event Propagation\n\n    Events triggered through the action helper will automatically have\n    `.preventDefault()` called on them. You do not need to do so in your event\n    handlers. If you need to allow event propagation (to handle file inputs for\n    example) you can supply the `preventDefault=false` option to the `{{action}}` helper:\n\n    ```handlebars\n    <div {{action \"sayHello\" preventDefault=false}}>\n      <input type=\"file\" />\n      <input type=\"checkbox\" />\n    </div>\n    ```\n\n    To disable bubbling, pass `bubbles=false` to the helper:\n\n    ```handlebars\n    <button {{action 'edit' post bubbles=false}}>Edit</button>\n    ```\n\n    If you need the default handler to trigger you should either register your\n    own event handler, or use event methods on your view class. See [Ember.View](/api/classes/Ember.View.html)\n    'Responding to Browser Events' for more information.\n\n    ### Specifying DOM event type\n\n    By default the `{{action}}` helper registers for DOM `click` events. You can\n    supply an `on` option to the helper to specify a different DOM event name:\n\n    ```handlebars\n    <div {{action \"anActionName\" on=\"doubleClick\"}}>\n      click me\n    </div>\n    ```\n\n    See `Ember.View` 'Responding to Browser Events' for a list of\n    acceptable DOM event names.\n\n    ### Specifying whitelisted modifier keys\n\n    By default the `{{action}}` helper will ignore click event with pressed modifier\n    keys. You can supply an `allowedKeys` option to specify which keys should not be ignored.\n\n    ```handlebars\n    <div {{action \"anActionName\" allowedKeys=\"alt\"}}>\n      click me\n    </div>\n    ```\n\n    This way the `{{action}}` will fire when clicking with the alt key pressed down.\n\n    Alternatively, supply \"any\" to the `allowedKeys` option to accept any combination of modifier keys.\n\n    ```handlebars\n    <div {{action \"anActionName\" allowedKeys=\"any\"}}>\n      click me with any key pressed\n    </div>\n    ```\n\n    ### Specifying a Target\n\n    There are several possible target objects for `{{action}}` helpers:\n\n    In a typical Ember application, where templates are managed through use of the\n    `{{outlet}}` helper, actions will bubble to the current controller, then\n    to the current route, and then up the route hierarchy.\n\n    Alternatively, a `target` option can be provided to the helper to change\n    which object will receive the method call. This option must be a path\n    to an object, accessible in the current context:\n\n    ```handlebars\n    {{! the application template }}\n    <div {{action \"anActionName\" target=view}}>\n      click me\n    </div>\n    ```\n\n    ```javascript\n    App.ApplicationView = Ember.View.extend({\n      actions: {\n        anActionName: function() {}\n      }\n    });\n\n    ```\n\n    ### Additional Parameters\n\n    You may specify additional parameters to the `{{action}}` helper. These\n    parameters are passed along as the arguments to the JavaScript function\n    implementing the action.\n\n    ```handlebars\n    {{#each person in people}}\n      <div {{action \"edit\" person}}>\n        click me\n      </div>\n    {{/each}}\n    ```\n\n    Clicking \"click me\" will trigger the `edit` method on the current controller\n    with the value of `person` as a parameter.\n\n    @method action\n    @for Ember.Handlebars.helpers\n    @param {String} actionName\n    @param {Object} [context]*\n    @param {Hash} options\n  */\n  function actionArgs(parameters, actionName) {\n    var ret, i, l;\n\n    if (actionName === undefined) {\n      ret = new Array(parameters.length);\n      for (i = 0, l = parameters.length; i < l; i++) {\n        ret[i] = streams__utils.readUnwrappedModel(parameters[i]);\n      }\n    } else {\n      ret = new Array(parameters.length + 1);\n      ret[0] = actionName;\n      for (i = 0, l = parameters.length; i < l; i++) {\n        ret[i + 1] = streams__utils.readUnwrappedModel(parameters[i]);\n      }\n    }\n\n    return ret;\n  }\n\n  var ActionHelper = {};\n\n  // registeredActions is re-exported for compatibility with older plugins\n  // that were using this undocumented API.\n  ActionHelper.registeredActions = ActionManager['default'].registeredActions;\n\n  var keys = [\"alt\", \"shift\", \"meta\", \"ctrl\"];\n\n  var POINTER_EVENT_TYPE_REGEX = /^click|mouse|touch/;\n\n  var isAllowedEvent = function (event, allowedKeys) {\n    if (typeof allowedKeys === \"undefined\") {\n      if (POINTER_EVENT_TYPE_REGEX.test(event.type)) {\n        return system__utils.isSimpleClick(event);\n      } else {\n        allowedKeys = \"\";\n      }\n    }\n\n    if (allowedKeys.indexOf(\"any\") >= 0) {\n      return true;\n    }\n\n    for (var i = 0, l = keys.length; i < l; i++) {\n      if (event[keys[i] + \"Key\"] && allowedKeys.indexOf(keys[i]) === -1) {\n        return false;\n      }\n    }\n\n    return true;\n  };\n\n  ActionHelper.registerAction = function (actionNameOrStream, options, allowedKeys) {\n    var actionId = utils.uuid();\n    var eventName = options.eventName;\n    var parameters = options.parameters;\n\n    ActionManager['default'].registeredActions[actionId] = {\n      eventName: eventName,\n      handler: function handleRegisteredAction(event) {\n        if (!isAllowedEvent(event, allowedKeys)) {\n          return true;\n        }\n\n        if (options.preventDefault !== false) {\n          event.preventDefault();\n        }\n\n        if (options.bubbles === false) {\n          event.stopPropagation();\n        }\n\n        var target = options.target.value();\n\n        var actionName;\n\n        if (ember_metal__streams__utils.isStream(actionNameOrStream)) {\n          actionName = actionNameOrStream.value();\n\n                  } else {\n          actionName = actionNameOrStream;\n        }\n\n        run['default'](function runRegisteredAction() {\n          if (target.send) {\n            target.send.apply(target, actionArgs(parameters, actionName));\n          } else {\n                        target[actionName].apply(target, actionArgs(parameters));\n          }\n        });\n      }\n    };\n\n    options.view.on(\"willClearRender\", function () {\n      delete ActionManager['default'].registeredActions[actionId];\n    });\n\n    return actionId;\n  };\n  function actionHelper(params, hash, options, env) {\n    var view = env.data.view;\n    var target;\n    if (!hash.target) {\n      target = view.getStream(\"controller\");\n    } else if (ember_metal__streams__utils.isStream(hash.target)) {\n      target = hash.target;\n    } else {\n      target = view.getStream(hash.target);\n    }\n\n    // Ember.assert(\"You specified a quoteless path to the {{action}} helper which did not resolve to an action name (a string).

This could\n      be useful, for instance, for retrieving async code from\n      the server that is required to enter a route.\n       ```javascript\n      App.PostRoute = Ember.Route.extend({\n        beforeModel: function(transition) {\n          if (!App.Post) {\n            return Ember.$.getScript('/models/post.js');\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       If `App.Post` doesn't exist in the above example,\n      `beforeModel` will use jQuery's `getScript`, which\n      returns a promise that resolves after the server has\n      successfully retrieved and executed the code from the\n      server. Note that if an error were to occur, it would\n      be passed to the `error` hook on `Ember.Route`, but\n      it's also possible to handle errors specific to\n      `beforeModel` right from within the hook (to distinguish\n      from the shared error handling behavior of the `error`\n      hook):\n       ```javascript\n      App.PostRoute = Ember.Route.extend({\n        beforeModel: function(transition) {\n          if (!App.Post) {\n            var self = this;\n            return Ember.$.getScript('post.js').then(null, function(e) {\n              self.transitionTo('help');\n               // Note that the above transitionTo will implicitly\n              // halt the transition. If you were to return\n              // nothing from this promise reject handler,\n              // according to promise semantics, that would\n              // convert the reject into a resolve and the\n              // transition would continue. To propagate the\n              // error so that it'd be handled by the `error`\n              // hook, you would have to\n              return Ember.RSVP.reject(e);\n            });\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       @method beforeModel\n      @param {Transition} transition\n      @return {Promise} if the value returned from this hook is\n        a promise, the transition will pause until the transition\n        resolves.

Default values will be used\n      based on the name of the route specified in the router or the Route's\n      `controllerName`, `viewName` and `templateName` properties.\n       For example:\n       ```javascript\n      // router\n      Router.map(function() {\n        this.route('index');\n        this.resource('post', { path: '/posts/:post_id' });\n      });\n      ```\n       ```javascript\n      // post route\n      PostRoute = App.Route.extend({\n        renderTemplate: function() {\n          this.render(); // all defaults apply\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       The name of the `PostRoute`, defined by the router, is `post`.\n       The following equivalent default options will be applied when\n      the Route calls `render`:\n       ```javascript\n      //\n      this.render('post', {  // the template name associated with 'post' Route\n        into: 'application', // the parent route to 'post' Route\n        outlet: 'main',      // {{outlet}} and {{outlet 'main' are synonymous}},\n        view: 'post',        // the view associated with the 'post' Route\n        controller: 'post',  // the controller associated with the 'post' Route\n      })\n      ```\n       By default the controller's `model` will be the route's model, so it does not\n      need to be passed unless you wish to change which model is being used.\n       @method render\n      @param {String} name the name of the template to render\n      @param {Object} [options] the options\n      @param {String} [options.into] the template to render into,\n                      referenced by name.

It is acceptable to not return anything (ie return undefined)\n    to invalidate the computation. This is generally not a good idea for\n    arrayComputed but it's used in eg max and min.\n\n    Note that observers will be fired if either of these functions return a value\n    that differs from the accumulated value.  When returning an object that\n    mutates in response to array changes, for example an array that maps\n    everything from some other array (see `Ember.computed.map`), it is usually\n    important that the *same* array be returned to avoid accidentally triggering observers.\n\n    Example\n\n    ```javascript\n    Ember.computed.max = function(dependentKey) {\n      return Ember.reduceComputed(dependentKey, {\n        initialValue: -Infinity,\n\n        addedItem: function(accumulatedValue, item, changeMeta, instanceMeta) {\n          return Math.max(accumulatedValue, item);\n        },\n\n        removedItem: function(accumulatedValue, item, changeMeta, instanceMeta) {\n          if (item < accumulatedValue) {\n            return accumulatedValue;\n          }\n        }\n      });\n    };\n    ```\n\n    Dependent keys may refer to `@this` to observe changes to the object itself,\n    which must be array-like, rather than a property of the object.  This is\n    mostly useful for array proxies, to ensure objects are retrieved via\n    `objectAtContent`.  This is how you could sort items by properties defined on an item controller.\n\n    Example\n\n    ```javascript\n    App.PeopleController = Ember.ArrayController.extend({\n      itemController: 'person',\n\n      sortedPeople: Ember.computed.sort('@this.@each.reversedName', function(personA, personB) {\n        // `reversedName` isn't defined on Person, but we have access to it via\n        // the item controller App.PersonController.  If we'd used\n        // `content.@each.reversedName` above, we would be getting the objects\n        // directly and not have access to `reversedName`.\n        //\n        var reversedNameA = get(personA, 'reversedName');\n        var reversedNameB = get(personB, 'reversedName');\n\n        return Ember.compare(reversedNameA, reversedNameB);\n      })\n    });\n\n    App.PersonController = Ember.ObjectController.extend({\n      reversedName: function() {\n        return reverse(get(this, 'name'));\n      }.property('name')\n    });\n    ```\n\n    Dependent keys whose values are not arrays are treated as regular\n    dependencies: when they change, the computed property is completely\n    recalculated.  It is sometimes useful to have dependent arrays with similar\n    semantics.  Dependent keys which end in `.[]` do not use \"one at a time\"\n    semantics.  When an item is added or removed from such a dependency, the\n    computed property is completely recomputed.\n\n    When the computed property is completely recomputed, the `accumulatedValue`\n    is discarded, it starts with `initialValue` again, and each item is passed\n    to `addedItem` in turn.\n\n    Example\n\n    ```javascript\n    Ember.Object.extend({\n      // When `string` is changed, `computed` is completely recomputed.\n      string: 'a string',\n\n      // When an item is added to `array`, `addedItem` is called.\n      array: [],\n\n      // When an item is added to `anotherArray`, `computed` is completely\n      // recomputed.\n      anotherArray: [],\n\n      computed: Ember.reduceComputed('string', 'array', 'anotherArray.[]', {\n        addedItem: addedItemCallback,\n        removedItem: removedItemCallback\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n\n    @method reduceComputed\n    @for Ember\n    @param {String} [dependentKeys*]\n    @param {Object} options\n    @return {Ember.ComputedProperty}\n  */\n  var cacheSet = computed.cacheFor.set;\n  var cacheGet = computed.cacheFor.get;\n  var cacheRemove = computed.cacheFor.remove;\n  var a_slice = [].slice;\n  // Here we explicitly don't allow `@each.foo`; it would require some special\n  // testing, but there's no particular reason why it should be disallowed.\n  var eachPropertyPattern = /^(.*)\\.@each\\.(.*)/;\n  var doubleEachPropertyPattern = /(.*\\.@each){2,}/;\n  var arrayBracketPattern = /\\.\\[\\]$/;\n\n  function get(obj, key) {\n    if (key === \"@this\") {\n      return obj;\n    }\n\n    return property_get.get(obj, key);\n  }\n\n  /*\n    Tracks changes to dependent arrays, as well as to properties of items in\n    dependent arrays.\n\n    @class DependentArraysObserver\n  */\n  function DependentArraysObserver(callbacks, cp, instanceMeta, context, propertyName, sugarMeta) {\n    // user specified callbacks for `addedItem` and `removedItem`\n    this.callbacks = callbacks;\n\n    // the computed property: remember these are shared across instances\n    this.cp = cp;\n\n    // the ReduceComputedPropertyInstanceMeta this DependentArraysObserver is\n    // associated with\n    this.instanceMeta = instanceMeta;\n\n    // A map of array guids to dependentKeys, for the given context.

You must have a length property. This property should change whenever\n       the number of items in your enumerable object changes. If you use this\n       with an `Ember.Object` subclass, you should be sure to change the length\n       property using `set().`\n\n    2. You must implement `nextObject().` See documentation.\n\n    Once you have these two methods implemented, apply the `Ember.Enumerable` mixin\n    to your class and you will be able to enumerate the contents of your object\n    like any other collection.\n\n    ## Using Ember Enumeration with Other Libraries\n\n    Many other libraries provide some kind of iterator or enumeration like\n    facility. This is often where the most common API conflicts occur.\n    Ember's API is designed to be as friendly as possible with other\n    libraries by implementing only methods that mostly correspond to the\n    JavaScript 1.8 API.\n\n    @class Enumerable\n    @namespace Ember\n    @since Ember 0.9\n  */\n  exports['default'] = mixin.Mixin.create({\n\n    /**\n      Implement this method to make your class enumerable.\n       This method will be called repeatedly during enumeration.

This is one of the fundamental ways that\n    models, controllers and views communicate with each other in an Ember\n    application.\n\n    Any object that has this mixin applied can be used in observer\n    operations. That includes `Ember.Object` and most objects you will\n    interact with as you write your Ember application.\n\n    Note that you will not generally apply this mixin to classes yourself,\n    but you will use the features provided by this module frequently, so it\n    is important to understand how to use it.\n\n    ## Using `get()` and `set()`\n\n    Because of Ember's support for bindings and observers, you will always\n    access properties using the get method, and set properties using the\n    set method. This allows the observing objects to be notified and\n    computed properties to be handled properly.\n\n    More documentation about `get` and `set` are below.\n\n    ## Observing Property Changes\n\n    You typically observe property changes simply by adding the `observes`\n    call to the end of your method declarations in classes that you write.\n    For example:\n\n    ```javascript\n    Ember.Object.extend({\n      valueObserver: function() {\n        // Executes whenever the \"value\" property changes\n      }.observes('value')\n    });\n    ```\n\n    Although this is the most common way to add an observer, this capability\n    is actually built into the `Ember.Object` class on top of two methods\n    defined in this mixin: `addObserver` and `removeObserver`. You can use\n    these two methods to add and remove observers yourself if you need to\n    do so at runtime.\n\n    To add an observer for a property, call:\n\n    ```javascript\n    object.addObserver('propertyKey', targetObject, targetAction)\n    ```\n\n    This will call the `targetAction` method on the `targetObject` whenever\n    the value of the `propertyKey` changes.\n\n    Note that if `propertyKey` is a computed property, the observer will be\n    called when any of the property dependencies are changed, even if the\n    resulting value of the computed property is unchanged. This is necessary\n    because computed properties are not computed until `get` is called.\n\n    @class Observable\n    @namespace Ember\n  */\n  exports['default'] = mixin.Mixin.create({\n\n    /**\n      Retrieves the value of a property from the object.\n       This method is usually similar to using `object[keyName]` or `object.keyName`,\n      however it supports both computed properties and the unknownProperty\n      handler.\n       Because `get` unifies the syntax for accessing all these kinds\n      of properties, it can make many refactorings easier, such as replacing a\n      simple property with a computed property, or vice versa.\n       ### Computed Properties\n       Computed properties are methods defined with the `property` modifier\n      declared at the end, such as:\n       ```javascript\n      fullName: function() {\n        return this.get('firstName') + ' ' + this.get('lastName');\n      }.property('firstName', 'lastName')\n      ```\n       When you call `get` on a computed property, the function will be\n      called and the return value will be returned instead of the function\n      itself.\n       ### Unknown Properties\n       Likewise, if you try to call `get` on a property whose value is\n      `undefined`, the `unknownProperty()` method will be called on the object.\n      If this method returns any value other than `undefined`, it will be returned\n      instead. This allows you to implement \"virtual\" properties that are\n      not defined upfront.\n       @method get\n      @param {String} keyName The property to retrieve\n      @return {Object} The property value or undefined.\n    */\n    get: function (keyName) {\n      return property_get.get(this, keyName);\n    },\n\n    /**\n      To get the values of multiple properties at once, call `getProperties`\n      with a list of strings or an array:\n       ```javascript\n      record.getProperties('firstName', 'lastName', 'zipCode');\n      // { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', zipCode: '10011' }\n      ```\n       is equivalent to:\n       ```javascript\n      record.getProperties(['firstName', 'lastName', 'zipCode']);\n      // { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', zipCode: '10011' }\n      ```\n       @method getProperties\n      @param {String...|Array} list of keys to get\n      @return {Hash}\n    */\n    getProperties: function () {\n      return utils.apply(null, getProperties['default'], [this].concat(slice.call(arguments)));\n    },\n\n    /**\n      Sets the provided key or path to the value.\n       This method is generally very similar to calling `object[key] = value` or\n      `object.key = value`, except that it provides support for computed\n      properties, the `setUnknownProperty()` method and property observers.\n       ### Computed Properties\n       If you try to set a value on a key that has a computed property handler\n      defined (see the `get()` method for an example), then `set()` will call\n      that method, passing both the value and key instead of simply changing\n      the value itself. This is useful for those times when you need to\n      implement a property that is composed of one or more member\n      properties.\n       ### Unknown Properties\n       If you try to set a value on a key that is undefined in the target\n      object, then the `setUnknownProperty()` handler will be called instead. This\n      gives you an opportunity to implement complex \"virtual\" properties that\n      are not predefined on the object. If `setUnknownProperty()` returns\n      undefined, then `set()` will simply set the value on the object.\n       ### Property Observers\n       In addition to changing the property, `set()` will also register a property\n      change with the object. Unless you have placed this call inside of a\n      `beginPropertyChanges()` and `endPropertyChanges(),` any \"local\" observers\n      (i.e. observer methods declared on the same object), will be called\n      immediately. Any \"remote\" observers (i.e. observer methods declared on\n      another object) will be placed in a queue and called at a later time in a\n      coalesced manner.\n       ### Chaining\n       In addition to property changes, `set()` returns the value of the object\n      itself so you can do chaining like this:\n       ```javascript\n      record.set('firstName', 'Charles').set('lastName', 'Jolley');\n      ```\n       @method set\n      @param {String} keyName The property to set\n      @param {Object} value The value to set or `null`.\n      @return {Ember.Observable}\n    */\n    set: function (keyName, value) {\n      property_set.set(this, keyName, value);\n      return this;\n    },\n\n    /**\n      Sets a list of properties at once. These properties are set inside\n      a single `beginPropertyChanges` and `endPropertyChanges` batch, so\n      observers will be buffered.\n       ```javascript\n      record.setProperties({ firstName: 'Charles', lastName: 'Jolley' });\n      ```\n       @method setProperties\n      @param {Hash} hash the hash of keys and values to set\n      @return {Ember.Observable}\n    */\n    setProperties: function (hash) {\n      return setProperties['default'](this, hash);\n    },\n\n    /**\n      Begins a grouping of property changes.\n       You can use this method to group property changes so that notifications\n      will not be sent until the changes are finished.

However, there are some cases where it is preferable\n      to build up a property's value by combining the superclass' property\n      value with the subclass' value. An example of this in use within Ember\n      is the `classNames` property of `Ember.View`.\n       Here is some sample code showing the difference between a concatenated\n      property and a normal one:\n       ```javascript\n      App.BarView = Ember.View.extend({\n        someNonConcatenatedProperty: ['bar'],\n        classNames: ['bar']\n      });\n       App.FooBarView = App.BarView.extend({\n        someNonConcatenatedProperty: ['foo'],\n        classNames: ['foo']\n      });\n       var fooBarView = App.FooBarView.create();\n      fooBarView.get('someNonConcatenatedProperty'); // ['foo']\n      fooBarView.get('classNames'); // ['ember-view', 'bar', 'foo']\n      ```\n       This behavior extends to object creation as well. Continuing the\n      above example:\n       ```javascript\n      var view = App.FooBarView.create({\n        someNonConcatenatedProperty: ['baz'],\n        classNames: ['baz']\n      })\n      view.get('someNonConcatenatedProperty'); // ['baz']\n      view.get('classNames'); // ['ember-view', 'bar', 'foo', 'baz']\n      ```\n      Adding a single property that is not an array will just add it in the array:\n       ```javascript\n      var view = App.FooBarView.create({\n        classNames: 'baz'\n      })\n      view.get('classNames'); // ['ember-view', 'bar', 'foo', 'baz']\n      ```\n       Using the `concatenatedProperties` property, we can tell Ember to mix the\n      content of the properties.\n       In `Ember.View` the `classNameBindings` and `attributeBindings` properties\n      are also concatenated, in addition to `classNames`.\n       This feature is available for you to use throughout the Ember object model,\n      although typical app developers are likely to use it infrequently. Since\n      it changes expectations about behavior of properties, you should properly\n      document its usage in each individual concatenated property (to not\n      mislead your users to think they can override the property in a subclass).\n       @property concatenatedProperties\n      @type Array\n      @default null\n    */\n    concatenatedProperties: null,\n\n    /**\n      Destroyed object property flag.\n       if this property is `true` the observers and bindings were already\n      removed by the effect of calling the `destroy()` method.\n       @property isDestroyed\n      @default false\n    */\n    isDestroyed: false,\n\n    /**\n      Destruction scheduled flag.

The `extend()` on line #8 creates a *subclass* of `App.Person`. Any instance of the `App.Person` class will *not* have the `march()` method.\n       You can also pass `Mixin` classes to add additional properties to the subclass.\n       ```javascript\n      App.Person = Ember.Object.extend({\n        say: function(thing) {\n          alert(this.get('name') + ' says: ' + thing);\n        }\n      });\n       App.SingingMixin = Mixin.create({\n        sing: function(thing){\n          alert(this.get('name') + ' sings: la la la ' + thing);\n        }\n      });\n       App.BroadwayStar = App.Person.extend(App.SingingMixin, {\n        dance: function() {\n          alert(this.get('name') + ' dances: tap tap tap tap ');\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       The `App.BroadwayStar` class contains three methods: `say()`, `sing()`, and `dance()`.\n       @method extend\n      @static\n       @param {Mixin} [mixins]* One or more Mixin classes\n      @param {Object} [arguments]* Object containing values to use within the new class\n    */\n    extend: function extend() {\n      var Class = makeCtor();\n      var proto;\n      Class.ClassMixin = mixin.Mixin.create(this.ClassMixin);\n      Class.PrototypeMixin = mixin.Mixin.create(this.PrototypeMixin);\n\n      Class.ClassMixin.ownerConstructor = Class;\n      Class.PrototypeMixin.ownerConstructor = Class;\n\n      reopen.apply(Class.PrototypeMixin, arguments);\n\n      Class.superclass = this;\n      Class.__super__ = this.prototype;\n\n      proto = Class.prototype = o_create['default'](this.prototype);\n      proto.constructor = Class;\n      utils.generateGuid(proto);\n      utils.meta(proto).proto = proto; // this will disable observers on prototype\n\n      Class.ClassMixin.apply(Class);\n      return Class;\n    },\n\n    /**\n      Equivalent to doing `extend(arguments).create()`.\n      If possible use the normal `create` method instead.\n       @method createWithMixins\n      @static\n      @param [arguments]*\n    */\n    createWithMixins: function () {\n      var C = this;\n      var l = arguments.length;\n      if (l > 0) {\n        var args = new Array(l);\n        for (var i = 0; i < l; i++) {\n          args[i] = arguments[i];\n        }\n        this._initMixins(args);\n      }\n      return new C();\n    },\n\n    /**\n      Creates an instance of a class.

Properties accessed in its templates go\n    to the view object and actions are targeted at\n    the view object. There is no access to the\n    surrounding context or outer controller; all\n    contextual information must be passed in.\n\n    The easiest way to create an `Ember.Component` is via\n    a template. If you name a template\n    `components/my-foo`, you will be able to use\n    `{{my-foo}}` in other templates, which will make\n    an instance of the isolated component.\n\n    ```handlebars\n    {{app-profile person=currentUser}}\n    ```\n\n    ```handlebars\n    <!-- app-profile template -->\n    <h1>{{person.title}}</h1>\n    <img {{bind-attr src=person.avatar}}>\n    <p class='signature'>{{person.signature}}</p>\n    ```\n\n    You can use `yield` inside a template to\n    include the **contents** of any block attached to\n    the component. The block will be executed in the\n    context of the surrounding context or outer controller:\n\n    ```handlebars\n    {{#app-profile person=currentUser}}\n      <p>Admin mode</p>\n      {{! Executed in the controller's context. }}\n    {{/app-profile}}\n    ```\n\n    ```handlebars\n    <!-- app-profile template -->\n    <h1>{{person.title}}</h1>\n    {{! Executed in the components context. }}\n    {{yield}} {{! block contents }}\n    ```\n\n    If you want to customize the component, in order to\n    handle events or actions, you implement a subclass\n    of `Ember.Component` named after the name of the\n    component. Note that `Component` needs to be appended to the name of\n    your subclass like `AppProfileComponent`.\n\n    For example, you could implement the action\n    `hello` for the `app-profile` component:\n\n    ```javascript\n    App.AppProfileComponent = Ember.Component.extend({\n      actions: {\n        hello: function(name) {\n          console.log(\"Hello\", name);\n        }\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n\n    And then use it in the component's template:\n\n    ```handlebars\n    <!-- app-profile template -->\n\n    <h1>{{person.title}}</h1>\n    {{yield}} <!-- block contents -->\n\n    <button {{action 'hello' person.name}}>\n      Say Hello to {{person.name}}\n    </button>\n    ```\n\n    Components must have a `-` in their name to avoid\n    conflicts with built-in controls that wrap HTML\n    elements. This is consistent with the same\n    requirement in web components.\n\n    @class Component\n    @namespace Ember\n    @extends Ember.View\n  */\n  var Component = View['default'].extend(TargetActionSupport['default'], ComponentTemplateDeprecation['default'], {\n    /*\n      This is set so that the proto inspection in appendTemplatedView does not\n      think that it should set the components `context` to that of the parent view.\n    */\n    controller: null,\n    context: null,\n\n    instrumentName: \"component\",\n    instrumentDisplay: computed.computed(function () {\n      if (this._debugContainerKey) {\n        return \"{{\" + this._debugContainerKey.split(\":\")[1] + \"}}\";\n      }\n    }),\n\n    /**\n    A components template property is set by passing a block\n    during its invocation.

You can\n    provide a `childViews` property at creation time that contains instance of\n    `Ember.View`:\n\n    ```javascript\n    aContainer = Ember.ContainerView.create({\n      childViews: [Ember.View.create(), Ember.View.create()]\n    });\n    ```\n\n    You can also provide a list of property names whose values are instances of\n    `Ember.View`:\n\n    ```javascript\n    aContainer = Ember.ContainerView.create({\n      childViews: ['aView', 'bView', 'cView'],\n      aView: Ember.View.create(),\n      bView: Ember.View.create(),\n      cView: Ember.View.create()\n    });\n    ```\n\n    The two strategies can be combined:\n\n    ```javascript\n    aContainer = Ember.ContainerView.create({\n      childViews: ['aView', Ember.View.create()],\n      aView: Ember.View.create()\n    });\n    ```\n\n    Each child view's rendering will be inserted into the container's rendered\n    HTML in the same order as its position in the `childViews` property.\n\n    ## Adding and Removing Child Views\n\n    The container view implements `Ember.MutableArray` allowing programmatic management of its child views.\n\n    To remove a view, pass that view into a `removeObject` call on the container view.\n\n    Given an empty `<body>` the following code\n\n    ```javascript\n    aContainer = Ember.ContainerView.create({\n      classNames: ['the-container'],\n      childViews: ['aView', 'bView'],\n      aView: Ember.View.create({\n        template: Ember.Handlebars.compile(\"A\")\n      }),\n      bView: Ember.View.create({\n        template: Ember.Handlebars.compile(\"B\")\n      })\n    });\n\n    aContainer.appendTo('body');\n    ```\n\n    Results in the HTML\n\n    ```html\n    <div class=\"ember-view the-container\">\n      <div class=\"ember-view\">A</div>\n      <div class=\"ember-view\">B</div>\n    </div>\n    ```\n\n    Removing a view\n\n    ```javascript\n    aContainer.toArray();  // [aContainer.aView, aContainer.bView]\n    aContainer.removeObject(aContainer.get('bView'));\n    aContainer.toArray();  // [aContainer.aView]\n    ```\n\n    Will result in the following HTML\n\n    ```html\n    <div class=\"ember-view the-container\">\n      <div class=\"ember-view\">A</div>\n    </div>\n    ```\n\n    Similarly, adding a child view is accomplished by adding `Ember.View` instances to the\n    container view.\n\n    Given an empty `<body>` the following code\n\n    ```javascript\n    aContainer = Ember.ContainerView.create({\n      classNames: ['the-container'],\n      childViews: ['aView', 'bView'],\n      aView: Ember.View.create({\n        template: Ember.Handlebars.compile(\"A\")\n      }),\n      bView: Ember.View.create({\n        template: Ember.Handlebars.compile(\"B\")\n      })\n    });\n\n    aContainer.appendTo('body');\n    ```\n\n    Results in the HTML\n\n    ```html\n    <div class=\"ember-view the-container\">\n      <div class=\"ember-view\">A</div>\n      <div class=\"ember-view\">B</div>\n    </div>\n    ```\n\n    Adding a view\n\n    ```javascript\n    AnotherViewClass = Ember.View.extend({\n      template: Ember.Handlebars.compile(\"Another view\")\n    });\n\n    aContainer.toArray();  // [aContainer.aView, aContainer.bView]\n    aContainer.pushObject(AnotherViewClass.create());\n    aContainer.toArray(); // [aContainer.aView, aContainer.bView, <AnotherViewClass instance>]\n    ```\n\n    Will result in the following HTML\n\n    ```html\n    <div class=\"ember-view the-container\">\n      <div class=\"ember-view\">A</div>\n      <div class=\"ember-view\">B</div>\n      <div class=\"ember-view\">Another view</div>\n    </div>\n    ```\n\n    ## Templates and Layout\n\n    A `template`, `templateName`, `defaultTemplate`, `layout`, `layoutName` or\n    `defaultLayout` property on a container view will not result in the template\n    or layout being rendered. The HTML contents of a `Ember.ContainerView`'s DOM\n    representation will only be the rendered HTML of its child views.\n\n    @class ContainerView\n    @namespace Ember\n    @extends Ember.View\n  */\n  var ContainerView = View['default'].extend(MutableArray['default'], {\n    _states: states,\n\n    willWatchProperty: function (prop) {\n          },\n\n    init: function () {\n      this._super.apply(this, arguments);\n\n      var childViews = property_get.get(this, \"childViews\");\n      \n      // redefine view's childViews property that was obliterated\n      properties.defineProperty(this, \"childViews\", View['default'].childViewsProperty);\n\n      var _childViews = this._childViews;\n\n      enumerable_utils.forEach(childViews, function (viewName, idx) {\n        var view;\n\n        if (\"string\" === typeof viewName) {\n          view = property_get.get(this, viewName);\n          view = this.createChildView(view);\n          property_set.set(this, viewName, view);\n        } else {\n          view = this.createChildView(viewName);\n        }\n\n        _childViews[idx] = view;\n      }, this);\n\n      var currentView = property_get.get(this, \"currentView\");\n      if (currentView) {\n        if (!_childViews.length) {\n          _childViews = this._childViews = this._childViews.slice();\n        }\n        _childViews.push(this.createChildView(currentView));\n      }\n    },\n\n    replace: function (idx, removedCount, addedViews) {\n      var addedCount = addedViews ? property_get.get(addedViews, \"length\") : 0;\n      var self = this;\n      \n      this.arrayContentWillChange(idx, removedCount, addedCount);\n      this.childViewsWillChange(this._childViews, idx, removedCount);\n\n      if (addedCount === 0) {\n        this._childViews.splice(idx, removedCount);\n      } else {\n        var args = [idx, removedCount].concat(addedViews);\n        if (addedViews.length && !this._childViews.length) {\n          this._childViews = this._childViews.slice();\n        }\n        this._childViews.splice.apply(this._childViews, args);\n      }\n\n      this.arrayContentDidChange(idx, removedCount, addedCount);\n      this.childViewsDidChange(this._childViews, idx, removedCount, addedCount);\n\n      return this;\n    },\n\n    objectAt: function (idx) {\n      return this._childViews[idx];\n    },\n\n    length: computed.computed(function () {\n      return this._childViews.length;\n    }).volatile(),\n\n    /**\n      Instructs each child view to render to the passed render buffer.\n       @private\n      @method render\n      @param {Ember.RenderBuffer} buffer the buffer to render to\n    */\n    render: function (buffer) {\n      var element = buffer.element();\n      var dom = buffer.dom;\n\n      if (this.tagName === \"\") {\n        element = dom.createDocumentFragment();\n        buffer._element = element;\n        this._childViewsMorph = dom.appendMorph(element, this._morph.contextualElement);\n      } else {\n        this._childViewsMorph = dom.appendMorph(element);\n      }\n\n      return element;\n    },\n\n    instrumentName: \"container\",\n\n    /**\n      When a child view is removed, destroy its element so that\n      it is removed from the DOM.\n       The array observer that triggers this action is set up in the\n      `renderToBuffer` method.\n       @private\n      @method childViewsWillChange\n      @param {Ember.Array} views the child views array before mutation\n      @param {Number} start the start position of the mutation\n      @param {Number} removed the number of child views removed\n    **/\n    childViewsWillChange: function (views, start, removed) {\n      this.propertyWillChange(\"childViews\");\n\n      if (removed > 0) {\n        var changedViews = views.slice(start, start + removed);\n        // transition to preRender before clearing parentView\n        this.currentState.childViewsWillChange(this, views, start, removed);\n        this.initializeViews(changedViews, null, null);\n      }\n    },\n\n    removeChild: function (child) {\n      this.removeObject(child);\n      return this;\n    },\n\n    /**\n      When a child view is added, make sure the DOM gets updated appropriately.\n       If the view has already rendered an element, we tell the child view to\n      create an element and insert it into the DOM.

[select](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element/select) HTML element,\n    allowing the user to choose from a list of options.\n\n    The text and `value` property of each `<option>` element within the\n    `<select>` element are populated from the objects in the `Element.Select`'s\n    `content` property. The underlying data object of the selected `<option>` is\n    stored in the `Element.Select`'s `value` property.\n\n    ## The Content Property (array of strings)\n\n    The simplest version of an `Ember.Select` takes an array of strings as its\n    `content` property. The string will be used as both the `value` property and\n    the inner text of each `<option>` element inside the rendered `<select>`.\n\n    Example:\n\n    ```javascript\n    App.ApplicationController = Ember.ObjectController.extend({\n      names: [\"Yehuda\", \"Tom\"]\n    });\n    ```\n\n    ```handlebars\n    {{view \"select\" content=names}}\n    ```\n\n    Would result in the following HTML:\n\n    ```html\n    <select class=\"ember-select\">\n      <option value=\"Yehuda\">Yehuda</option>\n      <option value=\"Tom\">Tom</option>\n    </select>\n    ```\n\n    You can control which `<option>` is selected through the `Ember.Select`'s\n    `value` property:\n\n    ```javascript\n    App.ApplicationController = Ember.ObjectController.extend({\n      selectedName: 'Tom',\n      names: [\"Yehuda\", \"Tom\"]\n    });\n    ```\n\n    ```handlebars\n    {{view \"select\" content=names value=selectedName}}\n    ```\n\n    Would result in the following HTML with the `<option>` for 'Tom' selected:\n\n    ```html\n    <select class=\"ember-select\">\n      <option value=\"Yehuda\">Yehuda</option>\n      <option value=\"Tom\" selected=\"selected\">Tom</option>\n    </select>\n    ```\n\n    A user interacting with the rendered `<select>` to choose \"Yehuda\" would\n    update the value of `selectedName` to \"Yehuda\".\n\n    ## The Content Property (array of Objects)\n\n    An `Ember.Select` can also take an array of JavaScript or Ember objects as\n    its `content` property.\n\n    When using objects you need to tell the `Ember.Select` which property should\n    be accessed on each object to supply the `value` attribute of the `<option>`\n    and which property should be used to supply the element text.\n\n    The `optionValuePath` option is used to specify the path on each object to\n    the desired property for the `value` attribute. The `optionLabelPath`\n    specifies the path on each object to the desired property for the\n    element's text. Both paths must reference each object itself as `content`:\n\n    ```javascript\n    App.ApplicationController = Ember.ObjectController.extend({\n      programmers: [\n        {firstName: \"Yehuda\", id: 1},\n        {firstName: \"Tom\",    id: 2}\n      ]\n    });\n    ```\n\n    ```handlebars\n    {{view \"select\"\n           content=programmers\n           optionValuePath=\"content.id\"\n           optionLabelPath=\"content.firstName\"}}\n    ```\n\n    Would result in the following HTML:\n\n    ```html\n    <select class=\"ember-select\">\n      <option value=\"1\">Yehuda</option>\n      <option value=\"2\">Tom</option>\n    </select>\n    ```\n\n    The `value` attribute of the selected `<option>` within an `Ember.Select`\n    can be bound to a property on another object:\n\n    ```javascript\n    App.ApplicationController = Ember.ObjectController.extend({\n      programmers: [\n        {firstName: \"Yehuda\", id: 1},\n        {firstName: \"Tom\",    id: 2}\n      ],\n      currentProgrammer: {\n        id: 2\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n\n    ```handlebars\n    {{view \"select\"\n           content=programmers\n           optionValuePath=\"content.id\"\n           optionLabelPath=\"content.firstName\"\n           value=currentProgrammer.id}}\n    ```\n\n    Would result in the following HTML with a selected option:\n\n    ```html\n    <select class=\"ember-select\">\n      <option value=\"1\">Yehuda</option>\n      <option value=\"2\" selected=\"selected\">Tom</option>\n    </select>\n    ```\n\n    Interacting with the rendered element by selecting the first option\n    ('Yehuda') will update the `id` of `currentProgrammer`\n    to match the `value` property of the newly selected `<option>`.\n\n    Alternatively, you can control selection through the underlying objects\n    used to render each object by binding the `selection` option. When the selected\n    `<option>` is changed, the property path provided to `selection`\n    will be updated to match the content object of the rendered `<option>`\n    element:\n\n    ```javascript\n\n    var yehuda = {firstName: \"Yehuda\", id: 1, bff4eva: 'tom'}\n    var tom = {firstName: \"Tom\", id: 2, bff4eva: 'yehuda'};\n\n    App.ApplicationController = Ember.ObjectController.extend({\n      selectedPerson: tom,\n      programmers: [ yehuda, tom ]\n    });\n    ```\n\n    ```handlebars\n    {{view \"select\"\n           content=programmers\n           optionValuePath=\"content.id\"\n           optionLabelPath=\"content.firstName\"\n           selection=selectedPerson}}\n    ```\n\n    Would result in the following HTML with a selected option:\n\n    ```html\n    <select class=\"ember-select\">\n      <option value=\"1\">Yehuda</option>\n      <option value=\"2\" selected=\"selected\">Tom</option>\n    </select>\n    ```\n\n    Interacting with the rendered element by selecting the first option\n    ('Yehuda') will update the `selectedPerson` to match the object of\n    the newly selected `<option>`. In this case it is the first object\n    in the `programmers`\n\n    ## Supplying a Prompt\n\n    A `null` value for the `Ember.Select`'s `value` or `selection` property\n    results in there being no `<option>` with a `selected` attribute:\n\n    ```javascript\n    App.ApplicationController = Ember.ObjectController.extend({\n      selectedProgrammer: null,\n      programmers: [\"Yehuda\", \"Tom\"]\n    });\n    ```\n\n    ``` handlebars\n    {{view \"select\"\n           content=programmers\n           value=selectedProgrammer\n    }}\n    ```\n\n    Would result in the following HTML:\n\n    ```html\n    <select class=\"ember-select\">\n      <option value=\"Yehuda\">Yehuda</option>\n      <option value=\"Tom\">Tom</option>\n    </select>\n    ```\n\n    Although `selectedProgrammer` is `null` and no `<option>`\n    has a `selected` attribute the rendered HTML will display the\n    first item as though it were selected. You can supply a string\n    value for the `Ember.Select` to display when there is no selection\n    with the `prompt` option:\n\n    ```javascript\n    App.ApplicationController = Ember.ObjectController.extend({\n      selectedProgrammer: null,\n      programmers: [ \"Yehuda\", \"Tom\" ]\n    });\n    ```\n\n    ```handlebars\n    {{view \"select\"\n           content=programmers\n           value=selectedProgrammer\n           prompt=\"Please select a name\"\n    }}\n    ```\n\n    Would result in the following HTML:\n\n    ```html\n    <select class=\"ember-select\">\n      <option>Please select a name</option>\n      <option value=\"Yehuda\">Yehuda</option>\n      <option value=\"Tom\">Tom</option>\n    </select>\n    ```\n\n    @class Select\n    @namespace Ember\n    @extends Ember.View\n  */\n  var Select = View['default'].extend({\n    instrumentDisplay: \"Ember.Select\",\n\n    tagName: \"select\",\n    classNames: [\"ember-select\"],\n    defaultTemplate: defaultTemplate,\n    attributeBindings: [\"autofocus\", \"autocomplete\", \"disabled\", \"form\", \"multiple\", \"name\", \"required\", \"size\", \"tabindex\"],\n\n    /**\n      The `multiple` attribute of the select element.

This\n    can be customized by setting the `tagName` property. The following view\n    class:\n\n    ```javascript\n    ParagraphView = Ember.View.extend({\n      tagName: 'em'\n    });\n    ```\n\n    Would result in instances with the following HTML:\n\n    ```html\n    <em id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\"></em>\n    ```\n\n    ## HTML `class` Attribute\n\n    The HTML `class` attribute of a view's tag can be set by providing a\n    `classNames` property that is set to an array of strings:\n\n    ```javascript\n    MyView = Ember.View.extend({\n      classNames: ['my-class', 'my-other-class']\n    });\n    ```\n\n    Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view my-class my-other-class\"></div>\n    ```\n\n    `class` attribute values can also be set by providing a `classNameBindings`\n    property set to an array of properties names for the view. The return value\n    of these properties will be added as part of the value for the view's `class`\n    attribute. These properties can be computed properties:\n\n    ```javascript\n    MyView = Ember.View.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['propertyA', 'propertyB'],\n      propertyA: 'from-a',\n      propertyB: function() {\n        if (someLogic) { return 'from-b'; }\n      }.property()\n    });\n    ```\n\n    Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view from-a from-b\"></div>\n    ```\n\n    If the value of a class name binding returns a boolean the property name\n    itself will be used as the class name if the property is true. The class name\n    will not be added if the value is `false` or `undefined`.\n\n    ```javascript\n    MyView = Ember.View.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['hovered'],\n      hovered: true\n    });\n    ```\n\n    Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view hovered\"></div>\n    ```\n\n    When using boolean class name bindings you can supply a string value other\n    than the property name for use as the `class` HTML attribute by appending the\n    preferred value after a \":\" character when defining the binding:\n\n    ```javascript\n    MyView = Ember.View.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['awesome:so-very-cool'],\n      awesome: true\n    });\n    ```\n\n    Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view so-very-cool\"></div>\n    ```\n\n    Boolean value class name bindings whose property names are in a\n    camelCase-style format will be converted to a dasherized format:\n\n    ```javascript\n    MyView = Ember.View.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['isUrgent'],\n      isUrgent: true\n    });\n    ```\n\n    Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view is-urgent\"></div>\n    ```\n\n    Class name bindings can also refer to object values that are found by\n    traversing a path relative to the view itself:\n\n    ```javascript\n    MyView = Ember.View.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['messages.empty']\n      messages: Ember.Object.create({\n        empty: true\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n\n    Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view empty\"></div>\n    ```\n\n    If you want to add a class name for a property which evaluates to true and\n    and a different class name if it evaluates to false, you can pass a binding\n    like this:\n\n    ```javascript\n    // Applies 'enabled' class when isEnabled is true and 'disabled' when isEnabled is false\n    Ember.View.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['isEnabled:enabled:disabled']\n      isEnabled: true\n    });\n    ```\n\n    Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view enabled\"></div>\n    ```\n\n    When isEnabled is `false`, the resulting HTML representation looks like\n    this:\n\n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view disabled\"></div>\n    ```\n\n    This syntax offers the convenience to add a class if a property is `false`:\n\n    ```javascript\n    // Applies no class when isEnabled is true and class 'disabled' when isEnabled is false\n    Ember.View.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['isEnabled::disabled']\n      isEnabled: true\n    });\n    ```\n\n    Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\"></div>\n    ```\n\n    When the `isEnabled` property on the view is set to `false`, it will result\n    in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view disabled\"></div>\n    ```\n\n    Updates to the the value of a class name binding will result in automatic\n    update of the  HTML `class` attribute in the view's rendered HTML\n    representation. If the value becomes `false` or `undefined` the class name\n    will be removed.\n\n    Both `classNames` and `classNameBindings` are concatenated properties. See\n    [Ember.Object](/api/classes/Ember.Object.html) documentation for more\n    information about concatenated properties.\n\n    ## HTML Attributes\n\n    The HTML attribute section of a view's tag can be set by providing an\n    `attributeBindings` property set to an array of property names on the view.\n    The return value of these properties will be used as the value of the view's\n    HTML associated attribute:\n\n    ```javascript\n    AnchorView = Ember.View.extend({\n      tagName: 'a',\n      attributeBindings: ['href'],\n      href: 'http://google.com'\n    });\n    ```\n\n    Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n    ```html\n    <a id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\" href=\"http://google.com\"></a>\n    ```\n\n    One property can be mapped on to another by placing a \":\" between\n    the source property and the destination property:\n\n    ```javascript\n    AnchorView = Ember.View.extend({\n      tagName: 'a',\n      attributeBindings: ['url:href'],\n      url: 'http://google.com'\n    });\n    ```\n\n    Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n    ```html\n    <a id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\" href=\"http://google.com\"></a>\n    ```\n\n    Namespaced attributes (e.g. `xlink:href`) are supported, but have to be\n    mapped, since `:` is not a valid character for properties in Javascript:\n\n    ```javascript\n    UseView = Ember.View.extend({\n      tagName: 'use',\n      attributeBindings: ['xlinkHref:xlink:href'],\n      xlinkHref: '#triangle'\n    });\n    ```\n    Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n    ```html\n    <use xlink:href=\"#triangle\"></use>\n    ```\n\n    If the return value of an `attributeBindings` monitored property is a boolean\n    the property will follow HTML's pattern of repeating the attribute's name as\n    its value:\n\n    ```javascript\n    MyTextInput = Ember.View.extend({\n      tagName: 'input',\n      attributeBindings: ['disabled'],\n      disabled: true\n    });\n    ```\n\n    Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n    ```html\n    <input id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\" disabled=\"disabled\" />\n    ```\n\n    `attributeBindings` can refer to computed properties:\n\n    ```javascript\n    MyTextInput = Ember.View.extend({\n      tagName: 'input',\n      attributeBindings: ['disabled'],\n      disabled: function() {\n        if (someLogic) {\n          return true;\n        } else {\n          return false;\n        }\n      }.property()\n    });\n    ```\n\n    Updates to the the property of an attribute binding will result in automatic\n    update of the  HTML attribute in the view's rendered HTML representation.\n\n    `attributeBindings` is a concatenated property. See [Ember.Object](/api/classes/Ember.Object.html)\n    documentation for more information about concatenated properties.\n\n    ## Templates\n\n    The HTML contents of a view's rendered representation are determined by its\n    template. Templates can be any function that accepts an optional context\n    parameter and returns a string of HTML that will be inserted within the\n    view's tag. Most typically in Ember this function will be a compiled\n    `Ember.Handlebars` template.\n\n    ```javascript\n    AView = Ember.View.extend({\n      template: Ember.Handlebars.compile('I am the template')\n    });\n    ```\n\n    Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\">I am the template</div>\n    ```\n\n    Within an Ember application is more common to define a Handlebars templates as\n    part of a page:\n\n    ```html\n    <script type='text/x-handlebars' data-template-name='some-template'>\n      Hello\n    </script>\n    ```\n\n    And associate it by name using a view's `templateName` property:\n\n    ```javascript\n    AView = Ember.View.extend({\n      templateName: 'some-template'\n    });\n    ```\n\n    If you have nested resources, your Handlebars template will look like this:\n\n    ```html\n    <script type='text/x-handlebars' data-template-name='posts/new'>\n      <h1>New Post</h1>\n    </script>\n    ```\n\n    And `templateName` property:\n\n    ```javascript\n    AView = Ember.View.extend({\n      templateName: 'posts/new'\n    });\n    ```\n\n    Using a value for `templateName` that does not have a Handlebars template\n    with a matching `data-template-name` attribute will throw an error.\n\n    For views classes that may have a template later defined (e.g. as the block\n    portion of a `{{view}}` Handlebars helper call in another template or in\n    a subclass), you can provide a `defaultTemplate` property set to compiled\n    template function. If a template is not later provided for the view instance\n    the `defaultTemplate` value will be used:\n\n    ```javascript\n    AView = Ember.View.extend({\n      defaultTemplate: Ember.Handlebars.compile('I was the default'),\n      template: null,\n      templateName: null\n    });\n    ```\n\n    Will result in instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\">I was the default</div>\n    ```\n\n    If a `template` or `templateName` is provided it will take precedence over\n    `defaultTemplate`:\n\n    ```javascript\n    AView = Ember.View.extend({\n      defaultTemplate: Ember.Handlebars.compile('I was the default')\n    });\n\n    aView = AView.create({\n      template: Ember.Handlebars.compile('I was the template, not default')\n    });\n    ```\n\n    Will result in the following HTML representation when rendered:\n\n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\">I was the template, not default</div>\n    ```\n\n    ## View Context\n\n    The default context of the compiled template is the view's controller:\n\n    ```javascript\n    AView = Ember.View.extend({\n      template: Ember.Handlebars.compile('Hello {{excitedGreeting}}')\n    });\n\n    aController = Ember.Object.create({\n      firstName: 'Barry',\n      excitedGreeting: function() {\n        return this.get(\"content.firstName\") + \"!!!\"\n      }.property()\n    });\n\n    aView = AView.create({\n      controller: aController\n    });\n    ```\n\n    Will result in an HTML representation of:\n\n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\">Hello Barry!!!</div>\n    ```\n\n    A context can also be explicitly supplied through the view's `context`\n    property. If the view has neither `context` nor `controller` properties, the\n    `parentView`'s context will be used.\n\n    ## Layouts\n\n    Views can have a secondary template that wraps their main template. Like\n    primary templates, layouts can be any function that  accepts an optional\n    context parameter and returns a string of HTML that will be inserted inside\n    view's tag. Views whose HTML element is self closing (e.g. `<input />`)\n    cannot have a layout and this property will be ignored.\n\n    Most typically in Ember a layout will be a compiled `Ember.Handlebars`\n    template.\n\n    A view's layout can be set directly with the `layout` property or reference\n    an existing Handlebars template by name with the `layoutName` property.\n\n    A template used as a layout must contain a single use of the Handlebars\n    `{{yield}}` helper. The HTML contents of a view's rendered `template` will be\n    inserted at this location:\n\n    ```javascript\n    AViewWithLayout = Ember.View.extend({\n      layout: Ember.Handlebars.compile(\"<div class='my-decorative-class'>{{yield}}</div>\"),\n      template: Ember.Handlebars.compile(\"I got wrapped\")\n    });\n    ```\n\n    Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\">\n      <div class=\"my-decorative-class\">\n        I got wrapped\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ```\n\n    See [Ember.Handlebars.helpers.yield](/api/classes/Ember.Handlebars.helpers.html#method_yield)\n    for more information.\n\n    ## Responding to Browser Events\n\n    Views can respond to user-initiated events in one of three ways: method\n    implementation, through an event manager, and through `{{action}}` helper use\n    in their template or layout.\n\n    ### Method Implementation\n\n    Views can respond to user-initiated events by implementing a method that\n    matches the event name. A `jQuery.Event` object will be passed as the\n    argument to this method.\n\n    ```javascript\n    AView = Ember.View.extend({\n      click: function(event) {\n        // will be called when when an instance's\n        // rendered element is clicked\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n\n    ### Event Managers\n\n    Views can define an object as their `eventManager` property. This object can\n    then implement methods that match the desired event names. Matching events\n    that occur on the view's rendered HTML or the rendered HTML of any of its DOM\n    descendants will trigger this method. A `jQuery.Event` object will be passed\n    as the first argument to the method and an  `Ember.View` object as the\n    second. The `Ember.View` will be the view whose rendered HTML was interacted\n    with. This may be the view with the `eventManager` property or one of its\n    descendant views.\n\n    ```javascript\n    AView = Ember.View.extend({\n      eventManager: Ember.Object.create({\n        doubleClick: function(event, view) {\n          // will be called when when an instance's\n          // rendered element or any rendering\n          // of this view's descendant\n          // elements is clicked\n        }\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n\n    An event defined for an event manager takes precedence over events of the\n    same name handled through methods on the view.\n\n    ```javascript\n    AView = Ember.View.extend({\n      mouseEnter: function(event) {\n        // will never trigger.\n      },\n      eventManager: Ember.Object.create({\n        mouseEnter: function(event, view) {\n          // takes precedence over AView#mouseEnter\n        }\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n\n    Similarly a view's event manager will take precedence for events of any views\n    rendered as a descendant. A method name that matches an event name will not\n    be called if the view instance was rendered inside the HTML representation of\n    a view that has an `eventManager` property defined that handles events of the\n    name. Events not handled by the event manager will still trigger method calls\n    on the descendant.\n\n    ```javascript\n    var App = Ember.Application.create();\n    App.OuterView = Ember.View.extend({\n      template: Ember.Handlebars.compile(\"outer {{#view 'inner'}}inner{{/view}} outer\"),\n      eventManager: Ember.Object.create({\n        mouseEnter: function(event, view) {\n          // view might be instance of either\n          // OuterView or InnerView depending on\n          // where on the page the user interaction occurred\n        }\n      })\n    });\n\n    App.InnerView = Ember.View.extend({\n      click: function(event) {\n        // will be called if rendered inside\n        // an OuterView because OuterView's\n        // eventManager doesn't handle click events\n      },\n      mouseEnter: function(event) {\n        // will never be called if rendered inside\n        // an OuterView.\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n\n    ### Handlebars `{{action}}` Helper\n\n    See [Handlebars.helpers.action](/api/classes/Ember.Handlebars.helpers.html#method_action).\n\n    ### Event Names\n\n    All of the event handling approaches described above respond to the same set\n    of events. The names of the built-in events are listed below. (The hash of\n    built-in events exists in `Ember.EventDispatcher`.) Additional, custom events\n    can be registered by using `Ember.Application.customEvents`.\n\n    Touch events:\n\n    * `touchStart`\n    * `touchMove`\n    * `touchEnd`\n    * `touchCancel`\n\n    Keyboard events\n\n    * `keyDown`\n    * `keyUp`\n    * `keyPress`\n\n    Mouse events\n\n    * `mouseDown`\n    * `mouseUp`\n    * `contextMenu`\n    * `click`\n    * `doubleClick`\n    * `mouseMove`\n    * `focusIn`\n    * `focusOut`\n    * `mouseEnter`\n    * `mouseLeave`\n\n    Form events:\n\n    * `submit`\n    * `change`\n    * `focusIn`\n    * `focusOut`\n    * `input`\n\n    HTML5 drag and drop events:\n\n    * `dragStart`\n    * `drag`\n    * `dragEnter`\n    * `dragLeave`\n    * `dragOver`\n    * `dragEnd`\n    * `drop`\n\n    ## Handlebars `{{view}}` Helper\n\n    Other `Ember.View` instances can be included as part of a view's template by\n    using the `{{view}}` Handlebars helper. See [Ember.Handlebars.helpers.view](/api/classes/Ember.Handlebars.helpers.html#method_view)\n    for additional information.\n\n    @class View\n    @namespace Ember\n    @extends Ember.CoreView\n  */\n  var View = CoreView['default'].extend(ViewStreamSupport['default'], ViewKeywordSupport['default'], ViewContextSupport['default'], ViewChildViewsSupport['default'], ViewStateSupport['default'], TemplateRenderingSupport['default'], ClassNamesSupport['default'], AttributeBindingsSupport['default'], LegacyViewSupport['default'], InstrumentationSupport['default'], VisibilitySupport['default'], {\n\n    /**\n      @property isView\n      @type Boolean\n      @default true\n      @static\n    */\n    isView: true,\n\n    // ..........................................................\n    // TEMPLATE SUPPORT\n    //\n\n    /**\n      The name of the template to lookup if no template is provided.\n       By default `Ember.View` will lookup a template with this name in\n      `Ember.TEMPLATES` (a shared global object).\n       @property templateName\n      @type String\n      @default null\n    */\n    templateName: null,\n\n    /**\n      The name of the layout to lookup if no layout is provided.\n       By default `Ember.View` will lookup a template with this name in\n      `Ember.TEMPLATES` (a shared global object).\n       @property layoutName\n      @type String\n      @default null\n    */\n    layoutName: null,\n\n    /**\n      The template used to render the view.

These hooks explain\n      the lexical environment of a Handlebars template, the internal\n      representation of references, and the interaction between an\n      HTMLBars template and the DOM it is managing.\n\n      While HTMLBars host hooks have access to all of this internal\n      machinery, templates and helpers have access to the abstraction\n      provided by the host hooks.\n\n      ## The Lexical Environment\n\n      The default lexical environment of an HTMLBars template includes:\n\n      * Any local variables, provided by *block arguments*\n      * The current value of `self`\n\n      ## Simple Nesting\n\n      Let's look at a simple template with a nested block:\n\n      ```hbs\n      <h1>{{title}}</h1>\n\n      {{#if author}}\n        <p class=\"byline\">{{author}}</p>\n      {{/if}}\n      ```\n\n      In this case, the lexical environment at the top-level of the\n      template does not change inside of the `if` block.

You can use `denodeify` in Node.js or the\n      browser when you'd prefer to use promises over using callbacks. For example,\n      `denodeify` transforms the following:\n\n      ```javascript\n      var fs = require('fs');\n\n      fs.readFile('myfile.txt', function(err, data){\n        if (err) return handleError(err);\n        handleData(data);\n      });\n      ```\n\n      into:\n\n      ```javascript\n      var fs = require('fs');\n      var readFile = RSVP.denodeify(fs.readFile);\n\n      readFile('myfile.txt').then(handleData, handleError);\n      ```\n\n      If the node function has multiple success parameters, then `denodeify`\n      just returns the first one:\n\n      ```javascript\n      var request = RSVP.denodeify(require('request'));\n\n      request('http://example.com').then(function(res) {\n        // ...\n      });\n      ```\n\n      However, if you need all success parameters, setting `denodeify`'s\n      second parameter to `true` causes it to return all success parameters\n      as an array:\n\n      ```javascript\n      var request = RSVP.denodeify(require('request'), true);\n\n      request('http://example.com').then(function(result) {\n        // result[0] -> res\n        // result[1] -> body\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Or if you pass it an array with names it returns the parameters as a hash:\n\n      ```javascript\n      var request = RSVP.denodeify(require('request'), ['res', 'body']);\n\n      request('http://example.com').then(function(result) {\n        // result.res\n        // result.body\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Sometimes you need to retain the `this`:\n\n      ```javascript\n      var app = require('express')();\n      var render = RSVP.denodeify(app.render.bind(app));\n      ```\n\n      The denodified function inherits from the original function. It works in all\n      environments, except IE 10 and below. Consequently all properties of the original\n      function are available to you. However, any properties you change on the\n      denodeified function won't be changed on the original function. Example:\n\n      ```javascript\n      var request = RSVP.denodeify(require('request')),\n          cookieJar = request.jar(); // <- Inheritance is used here\n\n      request('http://example.com', {jar: cookieJar}).then(function(res) {\n        // cookieJar.cookies holds now the cookies returned by example.com\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Using `denodeify` makes it easier to compose asynchronous operations instead\n      of using callbacks. For example, instead of:\n\n      ```javascript\n      var fs = require('fs');\n\n      fs.readFile('myfile.txt', function(err, data){\n        if (err) { ... } // Handle error\n        fs.writeFile('myfile2.txt', data, function(err){\n          if (err) { ... } // Handle error\n          console.log('done')\n        });\n      });\n      ```\n\n      you can chain the operations together using `then` from the returned promise:\n\n      ```javascript\n      var fs = require('fs');\n      var readFile = RSVP.denodeify(fs.readFile);\n      var writeFile = RSVP.denodeify(fs.writeFile);\n\n      readFile('myfile.txt').then(function(data){\n        return writeFile('myfile2.txt', data);\n      }).then(function(){\n        console.log('done')\n      }).catch(function(error){\n        // Handle error\n      });\n      ```\n\n      @method denodeify\n      @static\n      @for RSVP\n      @param {Function} nodeFunc a 'node-style' function that takes a callback as\n      its last argument. The callback expects an error to be passed as its first\n      argument (if an error occurred, otherwise null), and the value from the\n      operation as its second argument ('function(err, value){ }').\n      @param {Boolean|Array} argumentNames An optional paramter that if set\n      to `true` causes the promise to fulfill with the callback's success arguments\n      as an array. This is useful if the node function has multiple success\n      paramters. If you set this paramter to an array with names, the promise will\n      fulfill with a hash with these names as keys and the success parameters as\n      values.\n      @return {Function} a function that wraps `nodeFunc` to return an\n      `RSVP.Promise`\n      @static\n    */\n    __exports__[\"default\"] = function denodeify(nodeFunc, options) {\n      var fn = function() {\n        var self = this;\n        var l = arguments.length;\n        var args = new Array(l + 1);\n        var arg;\n        var promiseInput = false;\n\n        for (var i = 0;

The\n      primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n      registers callbacks to receive either a promise’s eventual value or the reason\n      why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n      Terminology\n      -----------\n\n      - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n      - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n      - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n      - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n      - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n      - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\n      A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n      Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n      state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n      rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\n      Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n      promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n      settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n      itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n      itself fulfill.\n\n\n      Basic Usage:\n      ------------\n\n      ```js\n      var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n        // on success\n        resolve(value);\n\n        // on failure\n        reject(reason);\n      });\n\n      promise.then(function(value) {\n        // on fulfillment\n      }, function(reason) {\n        // on rejection\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Advanced Usage:\n      ---------------\n\n      Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n      `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n      ```js\n      function getJSON(url) {\n        return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n          var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n          xhr.open('GET', url);\n          xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n          xhr.responseType = 'json';\n          xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n          xhr.send();\n\n          function handler() {\n            if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n              if (this.status === 200) {\n                resolve(this.response);\n              } else {\n                reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n              }\n            }\n          };\n        });\n      }\n\n      getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n        // on fulfillment\n      }, function(reason) {\n        // on rejection\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n      ```js\n      Promise.all([\n        getJSON('/posts'),\n        getJSON('/comments')\n      ]).then(function(values){\n        values[0] // => postsJSON\n        values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n        return values;\n      });\n      ```\n\n      @class RSVP.Promise\n      @param {function} resolver\n      @param {String} label optional string for labeling the promise.\n      Useful for tooling.\n      @constructor\n    */\n    function Promise(resolver, label) {\n      this._id = counter++;\n      this._label = label;\n      this._state = undefined;\n      this._result = undefined;\n      this._subscribers = [];\n\n      if (config.instrument) {\n        instrument('created', this);\n      }\n\n      if (noop !== resolver) {\n        if (!isFunction(resolver)) {\n          needsResolver();\n        }\n\n        if (!(this instanceof Promise)) {\n          needsNew();\n        }\n\n        initializePromise(this, resolver);\n      }\n    }\n\n    Promise.cast = Resolve; // deprecated\n    Promise.all = all;\n    Promise.race = race;\n    Promise.resolve = Resolve;\n    Promise.reject = Reject;\n\n    Promise.prototype = {\n      constructor: Promise,\n\n      _guidKey: guidKey,\n\n      _onerror: function (reason) {\n        config.trigger('error', reason);\n      },\n\n    /**\n      The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n      which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n      reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function(user){\n        // user is available\n      }, function(reason){\n        // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Chaining\n      --------\n\n      The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n      promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n      or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return user.name;\n      }, function (reason) {\n        return 'default name';\n      }).then(function (userName) {\n        // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n        // will be `'default name'`\n      });\n\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n      }, function (reason) {\n        throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n        // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n      });\n      ```\n      If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Assimilation\n      ------------\n\n      Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n      retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n      fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n      until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n      }).then(function (comments) {\n        // The user's comments are now available\n      });\n      ```\n\n      If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n      }).then(function (comments) {\n        // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Simple Example\n      --------------\n\n      Synchronous Example\n\n      ```javascript\n      var result;\n\n      try {\n        result = findResult();\n        // success\n      } catch(reason) {\n        // failure\n      }\n      ```\n\n      Errback Example\n\n      ```js\n      findResult(function(result, err){\n        if (err) {\n          // failure\n        } else {\n          // success\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Promise Example;\n\n      ```javascript\n      findResult().then(function(result){\n        // success\n      }, function(reason){\n        // failure\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Advanced Example\n      --------------\n\n      Synchronous Example\n\n      ```javascript\n      var author, books;\n\n      try {\n        author = findAuthor();\n        books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);\n        // success\n      } catch(reason) {\n        // failure\n      }\n      ```\n\n      Errback Example\n\n      ```js\n\n      function foundBooks(books) {\n\n      }\n\n      function failure(reason) {\n\n      }\n\n      findAuthor(function(author, err){\n        if (err) {\n          failure(err);\n          // failure\n        } else {\n          try {\n            findBoooksByAuthor(author, function(books, err) {\n              if (err) {\n                failure(err);\n              } else {\n                try {\n                  foundBooks(books);\n                } catch(reason) {\n                  failure(reason);\n                }\n              }\n            });\n          } catch(error) {\n            failure(err);\n          }\n          // success\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Promise Example;\n\n      ```javascript\n      findAuthor().\n        then(findBooksByAuthor).\n        then(function(books){\n          // found books\n      }).catch(function(reason){\n        // something went wrong\n      });\n      ```\n\n      @method then\n      @param {Function} onFulfilled\n      @param {Function} onRejected\n      @param {String} label optional string for labeling the promise.\n      Useful for tooling.\n      @return {Promise}\n    */\n      then: function(onFulfillment, onRejection, label) {\n        var parent = this;\n        var state = parent._state;\n\n        if (state === FULFILLED && !onFulfillment || state === REJECTED && !onRejection) {\n          if (config.instrument) {\n            instrument('chained', this, this);\n          }\n          return this;\n        }\n\n        parent._onerror = null;\n\n        var child = new this.constructor(noop, label);\n        var result = parent._result;\n\n        if (config.instrument) {\n          instrument('chained', parent, child);\n        }\n\n        if (state) {\n          var callback = arguments[state - 1];\n          config.async(function(){\n            invokeCallback(state, child, callback, result);\n          });\n        } else {\n          subscribe(parent, child, onFulfillment, onRejection);\n        }\n\n        return child;\n      },\n\n    /**\n      `catch` is simply sugar for `then(undefined, onRejection)` which makes it the same\n      as the catch block of a try/catch statement.\n\n      ```js\n      function findAuthor(){\n        throw new Error('couldn't find that author');\n      }\n\n      // synchronous\n      try {\n        findAuthor();\n      } catch(reason) {\n        // something went wrong\n      }\n\n      // async with promises\n      findAuthor().catch(function(reason){\n        // something went wrong\n      });\n      ```\n\n      @method catch\n      @param {Function} onRejection\n      @param {String} label optional string for labeling the promise.\n      Useful for tooling.\n      @return {Promise}\n    */\n      'catch': function(onRejection, label) {\n        return this.then(null, onRejection, label);\n      },\n\n    /**\n      `finally` will be invoked regardless of the promise's fate just as native\n      try/catch/finally behaves\n\n      Synchronous example:\n\n      ```js\n      findAuthor() {\n        if (Math.random() > 0.5) {\n          throw new Error();\n        }\n        return new Author();\n      }\n\n      try {\n        return findAuthor();
